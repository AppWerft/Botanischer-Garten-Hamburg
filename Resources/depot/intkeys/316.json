brown colors and blue to blue green bruising reaction are good field characters. The association with oak, the yellow hymenophore and yellow context indicate placement in section \\i{}Luteoscabra\\i0{}, but consistent bluing reactions have not been reported previously. First described from montane Colombia near Medellín, it is known in Costa Rica from sites near San Gerardo and Villa Mills in the Cordillera Talamanca.\u003e","\u003cOriginally described from one collection on the western slope of Volcan Irazu, \\i{}Leccinum cartagoense\\i0{} is encountered routinely in the Cordillera Talamanca and at Volcan Poas in the Cordillera Central. The fine pink scabers on the stipe surface and the intense chrome yellow stipe base are diagnostic. Originally described as a \\i{}Tylopilus \\i0{}(because of the pinkish flesh colored spore deposit), it is related to \\i{}T\\i0{}. (or \\i{}L\\i0{}.) \\i{}chromapes \\i0{}(see image chromap.jpg) of the Northern Hemisphere, but lacks the intense pink color of the pileus and is smaller in stature. There is a rare entity (see image subcart.jpg) of this group in Costa Rica that has a black pileus and seems to lack pink colored scabers on the stipe. Additional material is needed to assess the autonomy of this latter form.\u003e","\u003cThe pale violet to lilac stipe with fine scabers, brown pileus with purple overtones, and brown hymenophore are distinctive local field characters. Because of the atypical stipe ornamentation (compare \\i{}L. quercinum\\i0{}) and color of the spore deposit, some authors would place this taxon in \\i{}Tylopilus\\i0{}. Originally described from the northeastern USA, \\i{}L. eximium\\i0{} can be locally abundant in the Cordillera Central (Volcan Poas) and the Cordillera Talamanca. The Costa Rican material has a smaller stature and shorter spores (10-13 µm) than the forms from the northeastern United States (11-20 µm).\u003e","\u003cTaxa in this section of \\i{}Leccinum \\i0{}are characterized by a conspicuous and distinctive flap of sterile tissue at the margin of the pileus. Further, they frequently have a pileus that is colored some shade of orange or orange brown to red brown and context that changes to pink and/or fuscous when exposed. Many names have been used for \"species\" in this section, and the taxonomy is in disarray for taxa outside of Europe. Mycorrhizal associates in the Northern Hemisphere are typically members of the Betulaceae. However, some few species form mycorrhizal associations with members of the blueberry family (Ericaceae). \\i{}Leccinum monticola\\i0{} occurs among páramo vegetation on the summit of Cerro de la Muerte and is most likely associated with \\i{}Comarostyphylis arbutoides\\i0{}. Previously, we had encountered the fungus commonly at slightly lower elevations (2800-3000 m) in the Cordillera Talamanca where \\i{}Comarostaphylis\\i0{} occurs with \\i{}Quercus costaricensis\\i0{}. It has also been found on Volcan Irazu.\u003e","\u003cThis \\i{}Leccinum \\i0{}is reminiscent of \\i{}L. crocipodium\\i0{} as currently outlined by Lannoy and Estades (1995). Recent accounts in North America (Smith, Thiers, and Watling 1967; Smith and Thiers 1971) indicate that it occurs in the United States. However, as circumscribed by those authors, that taxon has a much lighter colored pileus, and perhaps more significantly, the context changes with exposure to a pinkish or salmon to reddish vinaceous and finally blackish. The Costa Rican material is consistently dark brown to dark red brown with immutable flesh.\u003e","\u003cAs the epithet indicates, the pileus surface is rugose; more so in some collections than in others. The hymenophore is pale yellow and the scabers on the stipe are pale caramel colored. The context of the basidiomata is white but soon changes to pink or pale red when exposed. It also belongs in sect. \\i{}Luteoscabra\\i0{}. Originally described from the eastern United States, \\i{}L. rugosiceps\\i0{} occurs under \\i{}Quercus \\i0{}as far south as southern Colombia. In Costa Rica, it seems to be uncommon but widespread in the montane oak forests.\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Leccinum tablense\\i0{} vaguely recalls features of \\i{}L. talamancae\\i0{}, but unlike that taxon it does not exhibit any oxidation reactions in the exposed flesh; pink to reddish orange in the pileus and upper part of the stipe and the blue-green to deep blue in the lower part of the stipe. The hymeniform nature of the pileipellis also is reminiscent of \\i{}L. talamancae\\i0{}, but in liieu of a description of fresh material they can be distinguished by spore size (14-16 × 4.9--6.3 µm for \\i{}L. tablense\\i0{}, and 17.5-22.5 × 4.9-6.3 µm for \\i{}L. talamancae\\i0{}). \\i{}Leccinum tablense\\i0{} also would fit the circumscription of subsection \\i{}Pseudoscabra \\i0{}as recently outlined by Lannoy and Estades (1995).\u003e","\u003cThe flesh is white at first when exposed, then becomes pink to reddish orange in the pileus and stipe apex. In mid-stipe the change is to a greenish blue and a deep, dark blue in the base of the stipe. These oxidation reactions appear to be consistent with this taxon. The pileus color seems to vary from a caramel to dark gray brown and typically is ±rugulose to rugose/wrinkled depending on individual collections. KOH is yellow to orange brown on the pileus surface. In a recent monograph of European Leccinums (Lannoy \u0026 Estades 1995), the Costa Rican material comes closest to \\i{}L. variicolor\\i0{} Watling in subsect. \\i{}Pseudoscabra\\i0{}. However, that species is apparently restricted to an association with \\i{}Betula \\i0{}and the pileipellis elements are cylindrical in shape not isodiametric. At present, \\i{}L. variicolor\\i0{} is unknown in the Americas, even though mycorrhizal host shifts have been documented and described for other agarics (e.g., Mueller \u0026 Strack 1992, Bougher \u0026 Malajczuk 1985, Bougher, et al. 1994). Clearly, more collecting in temperate and tropical America will provide a better picture of species composition and mycorrhizal associates.\u003e","\u003cThis species seems closest to \\i{}P. coccineus\\i0{} described by Corner (1970) from Singapore. The yellow basal mycelium as well as the overall colors are similar. The spores of both taxa are ovoid, an uncommon shape in the genus, and both lack clamp connections. However, Corner\\rquote{}s fungus has yellow flesh that is cyanescent, and the spores are larger (7.5-9 × 6.5-7.5 µm). The Costa Rican entity has yellow flesh but doesn\\rquote{}t change to blue green when exposed. There is a water soluble pigment which dissolves and turns microscopic mounts yellow. So far known only from one site in Cartago Province in the northern Talamancas.\u003e","\u003cFirst described from Singapore, Singer \u0026 Gómez (1984) cite collections from Japan, Mexico and Costa Rica. The diagnostic features are the white basal mycelium, cyanescent lamellae, and thin walled nonincrusted hymenial cystidia.\u003e","\u003cFirst described from collections gathered under \\i{}Alnus acuminata\\i0{} in northern Argentina, the species is widespread under the montane Neotropical alder from that country north to at least Costa Rica. The ectomycorrhizal association along with the white basal mycelium are good field characters.\u003e","\u003cThis species is characterized by the red brown pileus, white mycelium at the stipe base, lack of isodiametric cells in the pileipellis, and thick walled and encrusted hymenial cystidia. Also, the lamellae are rarely cyanescent. It is widespread in oak forests of the Cordillera Talamanca in Costa Rica.\u003e","\u003cOriginally described from Colombia, this \\i{}Phylloporus \\i0{}is not yet known from Costa Rica but might be expected to occur there. Other taxa that occur in both places include \\i{}Leccinum andinum\\i0{}, \\i{}Tylopilus obscurus\\i0{}, and \\i{}Rozites colombiana\\i0{}. Diagnostic features include the presence of clamp connections, fragrant odor, and the absence of a blue green reaction to ammonia. The subporoid hymenophore is also distinctive.\u003e","\u003cRecently described from a single collection found near Santa Cecilia in Guanacaste Province, just north of the Orosí volcano at 300 m elevation. The describing author placed the taxon in section \\i{}Manausenses. \\i0{}Amyloid spores appear unique in the genus so far. The above description is derived solely from the protologue. Additional collections are needed to complete the characterization of this taxon.\u003e","\u003cThe yellow mycelium at the stipe base, brown pileus, unchanging context, palisadic arrangement of hyphal elements in the piliepellis, and blue ammonia reaction are diagnostic. Variety \\i{}simplex \\i0{}is a known variant with thin walled, unencrusted hymenial cystidia. The species is also currently known from Colombia and Mexico.\u003e","\u003cThe above description is dervied from the protologue.
