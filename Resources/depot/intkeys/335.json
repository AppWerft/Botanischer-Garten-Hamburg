The species is particularly common in seepages and along streams. It forms large, dense stands that effectively exclude all other species of Restionaceae, and most other species of plants. The stands may become difficult to walk through. The plants are strongly rhizomatous, and large areas may be dominated by a single sex, and thus presumably by a single clone. The species seems to avoid high-energy streams.\u003e","\u003cAll populations occur in seepage areas, at least damp in winter. Most appear to be on sand, too, or at least sandy soils.

Both habitats are very well drained, and the species is absent from the wet hollows it characteristically inhabitats at Cape Point. It remains a very puzzling species ecologically.\u003e","\u003cThis species is almost restricted to damp habitats, seeps and along stream margins.

It is sometimes locally dominant.\u003e","\u003cA typical alpine species, often dominant in the alpine areas, it may at times form extensive monospecific stands. It seems to cope well with snow-cover. The coastal mountains appear to be too mesic for it. On the Matroosberg massif it dominates the shale-bands, but does also occur elsewhere.\u003e","\u003cIn damp habitats, in seepages and along stream margins. In the Reserve this is a common element of seasonally waterlogged habitats, which it shares with \\i{}Elegia cuspidata\\i0{}.\u003e","\u003cGenerally found in waterlogged areas, or in seepages which are wet most of the year.

The substrate is often described as peaty or mossy.\u003e","\u003cCommon along coastal sands, often matforming on the dunes directly behind the beaches. The deepseated spreading rhizomes is ideal for moving sands, and being deeply seated, is not readily exposed by moving sand.\u003e","\u003cVery common on rocky slopes, in well-drained habitats, this species can be locally dominant. It appears to occupy the same habitat as \\i{}I. virgea\\i0{}, and the two species alternate on the stony slopes between Zebasberg and Mt Superior.\u003e","\u003cWell-drained slopes. On the Bonteberg, at Corona, the species is very common along the lower slopes below the first set of cliffs, and is the dominant restio at this altitude. It is absent from the upper parts of the mountain here, being replaced by \\i{}I. karooica\\i0{} and a host of other species.

The plants are often among stones and rocks and general gravel. The species is also found on sandplains, both as \"suurvlaktes\" on the mountains, and on the West Coast. It is less common in well-drained habitats in the Langeberg. Throughout its range it is able to grow in exposed rocky habitats on ridges.\u003e","\u003cIn marshy places, sometimes on south-facing slopes, or in seepages. Along the Krom River above Du Toits Kloof the species grows on the river bank in slight seepages.\u003e","\u003cAlmost all records are from rocky places on summit ridges, these include \"among rocks\" (very common reference), \"rocky summit ridge\", \"rocky places\" and \"ledges near summit\". In the Slanghoek mountains the species is very common indeed on rocky platforms and cliffs (eg along the edge of shale bands). This is particularly the case around Slanghoek Pk. On the two Wellington Sneeukops it is more rare, but still in fire protected habitats.\u003e","\u003cOn the lower slopes of Audensberg in rugged, but hot and dry country, with \\i{}Heeria argentea\\i0{} and \\i{}Crassula rupestris\\i0{}, while near the summit it is found in dry, rocky places. Thus found over a surprising altitude range. I have seen it only at the summit of Audensberg, where it occurs on block-ridges amongst huge boulders, where fire never penetrates. The lower altitude records need checking.\u003e","\u003cIn marshes in wetland, and along stream-margins.\u003e","\u003cCommon on dry TMS slopes, especially in the arid parts of the fynbos region. Generally found on stony or rocky slopes, and tends to form big clumps next to boulders and along ledges.\u003e","\u003cThis species is found in damp to wet habitats, often in seepages or along the margins of seepages, or on plains which are seasonally waterlogged.

Most records are form near streams, or along stream-beds.\u003e","\u003cA species more or less restricted to well drained slopes, often on deeper sands. It seems to be absent from seepages, or from rocky habitats. There is one record from \"somewhat peaty sand\", and another from \"TMS gravels\", which probably indicate extremes in the habitat range.\u003e","\u003cCommon in fynbos on well-drained soils, ranging from fairly stony, gravelly slopes on the Swartberg to slopes with deeper, organic soils in the Langeberg. It is absent from seepages and seasonally wet conditions.\u003e","\u003cForming great masses on the upper south-facing slopes, where the plants receive rain and fog throughout the year.\u003e","\u003cOccasional on leached coastal sands, not common.

Occasional populations are found at much lower altitudes, and on Nardouwspass a population is in dry fynbos at 550 m.\u003e","\u003cRestricted to marshy or wet places. Many collections are from seepages and marshes, where the species is often found with \\i{}Anthochortus crinalis\\i0{}. However, the most common habitat appears to be on wet rock ledges, often on south-facing aspects where the plants collect moisture from south-easter clouds. Here they form great masses and hang down the rocks. On the south slopes below Kogelberg the species is very common in gaps in the vegetation and on small ledges.\u003e","\u003cThis species occurs occasionally among rocks on sandy plains. It may prefer the shelter of large sandstone boulders or outcrops, but grows in deep, well-drained sand. It forms large clumps next to these rock outcrops.

The species avoids seepages and sheltered localities, and is not usually associated with big sandstone boulders.\u003e","\u003cThis species is largely restricted to deep sandy soils, usually not associated with bedrock outcrops or a rocky surface. These are found along stream valleys, and on the coastal plains. It is generally associated with seasonally waterlogged habitats, sandstones, recent sands, and sandy loams derived from shales. Also in drier habitats, where there is seepage in winter.\u003e","\u003cIn dry fynbos, on well-drained, stony soils. Many of the herbarium labels indicate moist sand, suggesting slight seepages.\u003e","\u003cAt Riverlands the species was observed on well-drained acidic sand.

Also in road-side ditches.\u003e","\u003cIn the mountains north of Du Toits Kloof this species is common on well-drained slopes, often with some stony outcrops. Around the stony, drier margins of the sandy Suurvlakte it can even be locally dominant. It is absent from the seasonally waterlogged sandy parts of the plain, and can reach quite high up on the stony mountain sides. The larges populations, though, are on the rocky and stony fringes of the sandy plain.\u003e","\u003cGenerally found in places with ground-water. Most commonly along stream-margins, where the plants are often found hanging over the streams. It also occurs in seepages, but less commonly so. On Skerpioensberg in the Northern Cederberg it forms large monospecific stands in the occasionally waterlogged basins. Plants usually form colonies, rarely of isolated individuals.\u003e","\u003cMost commonly found on well-drained slopes among rocks. In more heavily burnt areas the species appears to be restricted to areas with rocky outcrops, it is not clear whether this is to avoid fire, or for some other reason. Even in unburnt areas the species is mostly associated with rock outcrops. It is characteristic of the drier inland edge of the mountains, and is missing from the cooler, moister mountains. In the cooler Hex River mts, the species is restricted to the lower slopes.\u003e","\u003cThis species seems to be associated with rocky habitats: along streamlines, on ridges. Often also found in seepages or places with ground water. It seems rarely to form large stands.\u003e","\u003cThe species has only been recorded from seasonally waterlogged conditions.

Also in recesses on rocky slopes and in gullies, habitats typical of the upper rocky slopes of the Cape mountains.

Both locations showed some disturbance, the Skurweberg Pass population showed substantial disturbance.\u003e","\u003cThis species is quite common on dry, well drained, stony slopes. It is usually well intergrated into the surrounding vegetation, with isolated shoots rising from spreading stolons. This effectively makes the plants difficult to see, and has probably resulted in an undercollecting of the species. The males, which at flowering are much more visible than the females, have been collected more frequently.\u003e","\u003cThis species is found on shallow, well drained soils, often stony. It avoids the deeper, organic soils on the south-facing slopes, and seepages. There are no deep sandy flats in this area.\u003e","\u003cVery common on dry sandy to stony slopes, may be the dominant restio in some areas, often in slight seepages, sometimes even in wet conditions.

It has been observed black peaty soil, not in deep marshes are on dry rocky slopes. On the Clock Peaks the population was in well-drained soil among rock, so the habitat characteristisation based on Garcias Pass might be incorrect.\u003e","\u003cLocally common, but in several diverse habitats, the common theme being proximity to rock. In Jonkershoek the species is found on rocky slopes, among rocks, on ledges, possibly where there is a slight seepage. On Pilaarkop it is found on peaty south-facing slopes, along the edge of rock outcrops.\u003e","\u003cI am treating this species as restricted to the well-drained acidic coastal sands, or the dry foothills of the northern mountains. Here it grows away from seepages, scattered in the general vegetation.\u003e","\u003cSeasonally waterlogged habitats on loamy sand, usually over an impervious laterite layer, in lowland conditions: the Worcester valley, and the flats between the Cape Peninsula and Wellington.

Above Betty\u0027s Bay the plants grow on the damp, black soils on south-facing slopes, mixed into the general vegetation.\u003e","\u003cMostly recorded from among rocks and on ledges on cool, somewhat sheltered, south-facing slopes. On Jonaskop it may be locally common on ledges on south-facing cliffs.\u003e","\u003cOn the Matroosberg massif (Sonklip, Matroosberg, Roodeberg) the species is very common above 1800 m. It is found on stony slopes, sandy plains, and shallow soils over bedrock. It appears to occur where other species are excluded: both on well-drained habitats, and in slight seepages over bedrock. Maybe the critical factor is not the soil environment, but competition from taller restios. On the summit plateau of Matroosberg peak \\i{}I. pygmaea\\i0{} is the only restioid in large areas in the very harsh environment, with larger tussocks of \\i{}Staberoha remota\\i0{}.\u003e","\u003cDamp localities, often near seeps.

At Tierberg on the Great Swartberg I saw it growing in short fynbos along the summit ridges, and on the Witteberg on the south-facing slopes at and below the summits. From Keeromsberg it has been recorded from gullies. There seems to be no indication of a preference for seepages and rockledges.\u003e","\u003cMost populations are found in sandy localities with impeded drainage, which are waterlogged or at least damp during winter. I have seen a number of populations throughout the range that fit this definition. It is possible that the few montane populations are in similar conditions, possibly on coastal sand blown into the mountains. A second peculiarity is the shortage of male plants, and in several populations only females have been recorded. The possibility of apomixis should be investigated.\u003e","\u003cLocally dominant along seasonal streams on sandy suurvlakte plains, plants forming extensive mats, which appear to be a tangle of many different plants, as the sexes are well mixed.\u003e","\u003cGenerally found in damp sand over rock, where there are slight seepages.

In these habitats the plants are described as forming dense masses, which suggests that they are part of the typical marsh flora.\u003e","\u003cI have observed this species on rocky summit ridges, often exposed to south-easterly cloud, thus on steep south-facing slopes, among rocks, where it often forming tangled mats. This seems to fit most fieldnotes, as well. This might account for the enormous range in the species, as plants growing in shadier places might be lankier, than those in more exposed places.\u003e","\u003cMost of the herbarium labels mention a habitat in slight seeps or heavier soils; but I have also seen the species on well-drained stony slopes on Pilaarkop. It is absent from the higher-rainfall areas closer to the coast.\u003e","\u003cThe plants are most common where there is some ground-water, either along stream-lines, watercourses, or seepages.

The plants often fill the gullys and passages among the rocks, and the species seems to be able to grow on the cold, shady south sides of these typical gaint sandstone blocks. Most of the populations will regularly receive snow, and at least some will be snow-covered from several weeks, due to the micro-habitat. Thus it is often dominant on the rocky summits of some Cape mountains.\u003e","\u003cSouth facing slopes receiving sea-air, growing dispersed in the vegetation on well-drained slopes.

It is particularly common to locally dominant on the upper slopes, above 1500 m, and may be the most common species in this habitat.\u003e","\u003cFound mostly along permanent streams, where the plants are found in sandbanks, or in cracks in bedrock or rock paving. The plants are usually within the flood zone, and persist by remarkably tough bases. The species may be locally quite common, but also seems to consists of rather few, isolated populations. From herbarium records it appears that some collections come from valley bottoms, where they seem to form extensive stands. This seems to be the only Restionaceae species that regularly occurs in streambeds.\u003e","\u003cVery common on well-drained stony slopes, often the dominant species, sharing the habitat with \\i{}Cannomois nitida\\i0{}. The species is found on the summit ridge and the upper south-facing slopes, but is absent from the north-facing slopes. On Roodeberg it is found on the harsh, dry west-facing slopes.\u003e","\u003cLocally common in seasonally waterlogged areas. At Malangeni it is recorded from black soil at the edge of the swamp forest, from seasonally inundated soil.\u003e","\u003cThe species is found both on granites and sandstones, and seems frequent on gravelly soils. Several records indicate shallow soils over rock, in places where otherwise bare patches would occur. Also recorded from around ant heaps, and on rock flushes. Collected in the Rivierzondereinde mountains from a well drained, pebbly slope, in an area where a pine infestation had been cleared.\u003e","\u003cAn alpine species, found only on the summit ridges of the Swartberg. The plants grow in well-drained habitats, very exposed, in stony soil. They seem to be absent from cliffs and shady habitats.\u003e","\u003cRestricted to sandstone outcrops in the very arid fynbos on the low hills and lower slopes, in well drained localities. The species is often locally dominant, forming extensive and quite dense populations. However, it can also occur as scattered individuals.\u003e","\u003cA widespread species of the arid inland margins of the Cape ranges, generally in areas of low rainfall. The species is most often found in damp localities, in loamy soils along streams or in seeps, or in shallow soils over rock, in western Cape in deep colluvial soils, somewhat richer than Table Mountain sandstone. Towards the east, the species is typical of quartzite outcrops.\u003e","\u003cA relatively common species in the mesic fynbos typical of the south-facing slopes and cool valleys of the Langeberg. The species is found generally in well-drained habitats, often on shale bands, and often associated with occasional rock outcrops. It does not form large populations, occurring more as isolated plants.\u003e","\u003cThis is one of the most widespread restionaceous species in South Africa. In the winter-rainfall areas it is associated with dry fynbos at lower altitudes, often in very dry habitats. It is generally found on gravelly soils, derived either from sandstone or laterites. This is particularly striking in the western parts of its distribution range. Towards the east it is more associated with Witteberg quartzites and sandstones. In the Drakensberg the species is found on Cape Sandstone outcrops. It appears to thrive in over-grazed areas, particularly around Grahamstown.\u003e","\u003cA species of mesic fynbos, found on deeper soils usually, on the wet coastal slopes of the mountains. It is a typical element of this dense vegetation, the tall plants often overtopping the other species and making a spectacular display. There is a report of at least the male inflorescences being eaten by elephant (pers com G. Patterson, 6 Nov. 2001)\u003e","\u003cThe species is typically found on moist, loamy soils, where there are slight seepages. On Robinson Pass it grows along a jeep road in very shallow loamy sand over bedrock, possibly waterlogged with rain and very dry in summer, and regularly disturbed. It is absent from the general dense vegetation typical of deeper soils, and so seems to be localised in areas where the general vegetation is not able to grow. It is also locally dominant on small cliffs, in the shallow soil over the bedrock, and in slight seepages. From the Rooiberg Hugh Taylor recorded it from \"On bed rock of ridge\".\u003e","\u003cCommon on rocky slopes, especially where bedrock crops out, absent from sandy plains, occasional to absent from gravelly slopes. Always in well-drained habitats.\u003e","\u003cAlong streams and in marshy places, often on shale bands or slightly heavier soils. Occurring as large, isolated clumps, rarely forming dense stands. Often associated with the sedge-grass vegetation of deep soils on shale bands. On Kogelberg summit it is a very common understory restioid, forming extensive mats.\u003e","\u003cAn alpine species, forms relatively dense local patches on plains, both sandy and somewhat gravelly, and on gentle slopes, a very striking species. In the Northern Cederberg it is a common element on the seasonally arid sandplains around Heuningvlei.\u003e","\u003cLocally common on well-drained, usually stony sandy soils. Often forms quite dense and extensive stands.\u003e","\u003cWell-drained slopes, in Swartberg common in mesic upper south-facing vegetation, quite diverse in its habitat, while in the Langeberg it is found on the dry inland base of the mountains.\u003e","\u003cCommon on dry sandy habitats, well-drained. Often forming small populations, but never forming extensive stands.\u003e","\u003cWell-drained sandy slopes\u003e","\u003cCommon on `suur- vlaktes\u0027 in the Ceres - Cederberg area, where it grows in well-drained habitats. It can be locally quite common, possibly even dominant.\u003e","\u003cMost collections indicate a marshy or peaty habitat on small sandy plains, or also from rocky areas on shale bands. Winter waterlogging appears to be typical for this species. On Matroosberg the species is very common above 1900 m, occurring in all rocky habitats, but absent from seepages or deep sandy plains. It is, with \\i{}Restio pygmaeus\\i0{}, the dominant restioid on the bleak summit plateau of Matroosberg peak. Below 1900 m the species is found in a few seeps at the lower margins of shale bands.\u003e","\u003cRestricted to south-facing ledges on the upper rocky peaks, absent from deeper soil around the cliffs, and from the summits of the ridges and the north-facing slopes. These cliffs intercept substantial cloud drifting in from the Indian Ocean, and also substantial snow and ice in winter. The species is locally very common, restricted to these fire refuges.\u003e","\u003cModerately drained scrubby fynbos, often among rocks near seeps, often only a few plants\u003e","\u003cLocally common or rare (usually the latter) on well-drained soils.

The few mountain occurrences deserve some more investigation.\u003e","\u003cFound in a wide range of conditions, from well-drained soils to seepages and stream-margins, and even in light shade under riverine woodland. On the whole, the plants require a good water supply in summer - either from streams and seeps, or from substantial summer rain and fog. It is one of the most common species on the south-facing slopes of the Langeberg - Outeniqua - Tzitzikamma fynbos, usually occurring as scattered individuals.\u003e","\u003cThis species seems to be locally abundant, mostly in sandy areas which might be seasonally wet. One collection is from near the margins of wet hollows. Others refer to stony sand.\u003e","\u003cThis species grows in dry fynbos along N slopes of Langeberg. The collections are from well-drained gravelly soils on sandstone.\u003e","\u003cThe species is found in well-drained soils, from coastal dunes inland to coastal sand blown over sandstone bedrock.\u003e","\u003cThis species is locally common on well-drained limestone slopes and pavement. Usually with short vegetation, and locally dominating the vegetation. Some records indicate a mixture of sandstone and limestone, but the whole distribution seems to be restricted to lime-stone outcrops, suggesting that our species is a calciphile.\u003e","\u003cWidespread on sandy slopes, more rare on stony slopes. This species is found both in marshy areas, as well as well-drained habitats. It ranges from near sea level, to mid-altitudes on the inland mountains. It ranges from fairly wet mountains (like Bainskloof), to the arid fringes of fynbos on Touwsberg and Slypsteenberg. Although most records are from sandstone, there are also indications that it can also grow in loamier conditions.\u003e","\u003cTypically found on grassy bluffs overlooking the sea, often with other fynbos outliers. In the Humansdorp area it is on deep coastal sand and sanddunes, no rock. Probably quite alkaline.\u003e","\u003cThis species is common on well-drained soils, and often seems to prefer sandy soils. However, there are also collections from very rocky places (ledges along the Left Face route up the North Wall of Table Mountain). I have not seen the species in seasonally waterlogged or damp habitats.\u003e","\u003cThis species is typically found in gravelly soils on low hills and along the bases of the mountains. These could be derived from laterites or sandstone gravel, or granite. It occurs in well-drained conditions, and may at times become quite common. It appears to respond well to light disturbance, and becomes common in grazed areas.\u003e","\u003cThe natural habitat of the species is on well-drained sands, generally found in dune slacks or on somewhat loamier conditions along the inland margins of the dunes. The species will naturally form quite extensive stands, but veld management is used to make these stands much denser. It is rarely found directly on limestone (and then the plants usually look rather poor), but more commonly on deeper sands, probably derived from the limestones.\u003e","\u003cAn aridity-loving species, found in very dry fynbos along the northern (inland) base of Langeberg, as well as on the Little Karoo mountains.

It is absent from sandy plains and marshy places.\u003e","\u003cA species of deep sand habitats in limestone country, but not necessarily on limestone. It seems to be an early succession plant, found in abandoned fields. It is ecologically rather poorly known.\u003e","\u003cOne of the dominant species of the Upper Table on Table Mountain. The species grows in shallow soil over bedrock, in a habitat which is often waterlogged, especially when the south-easter clouds lie over the mountain. The plants are effective in trapping moisture from the clouds, as is evidenced from the moss-beds at the base of the plants. The area is often waterlogged in winter, and if there is a prolonged period in summer without a south-easter cloud, can become very dry. The species avoids the wetter waterlogged areas, which are mostly dominated by \\i{}Restio bifidus\\i0{}.\u003e","\u003cAlmost all records are from deep sand. This seems always to be of coastal origin, and where the species is found on Table Mountain Sandstone, it grows in sand which might have been blown in. It is found in well-drained habitats, and often forms a sparse understory under other fynbos species, and in gaps between other species. There is an excellent series of collections by Elsie Esterhuysen from the southern Peninsula documenting the phenology and habitat of the species. The species seems to consist of isolated and rather scattered individuals, but each occupies a considerable area, spreading by means of its formidable rhizome.\u003e","\u003cA species restricted to well-drained slopes, usually over limestone pavement. This is a bleak, exposed habitat, and \\i{}T. paniculatus\\i0{} is often the only species there.\u003e","\u003cThis high-altitude species is found in well-drained habitats in stony places, or in shallow, stony soil over rock.

It is quite common along the upper slopes, often dominant in suitable habitats.\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Thamnochortus pellucidus\\i0{} is generally found in well-drained sand, occasionally slightly more peaty conditions. It seems to prefer loose sand, and I have seen it on road verges in very loose sand, and one of the herbarium records also indicates windblown sand as a habitat. It often forms small populations. The interval between Kleinmond and Pearly Beach is curious, since suitable habitat should occur in the Walker Bay area, but maybe this large sandy plain has not been adequately botanised.\u003e","\u003cLocally common in arid fynbos, usually on sandy soils or open areas, less common among rock outcrops.

It is one of the few Restionaceae found in \"strandveld\", a vegetation of largely tropical woody species, found in the more alkaline recent sands along the sea front. The species is locally common in the thickets, with its tall growth it can compete directly with the shrubs.\u003e","\u003cThis species has been collected most commonly from alluvial / sandy plains or river valleys along the pediments of the mountains, or on lower plateaux: typically where large mountain streams exit from the mountains, forming broad flat sandy valleys. Rather fewer collections are from sandy or gravelly plateaux, such as Silvermine on the Cape Peninsula, and Avontuur on Piketberg. Rather fewer collections are from clayey lower mountains slopes. Generally the species occurs as isolated plants, not forming dense stands.

These are: (a) a slender form, that is generally less than 50 cm tall, with slender culms adn small flowers. This appears to be most common along the coastal mountains, and seems to flower after Christmas (b) a robust form, to 2 m tall, with stout culms and large flowers. This forms massive tussocks on the inland mountains (\\i{}E. marlothii\\i0{} and \\i{}E. aggregata\\i0{}). In addition to this variation, the species is close to \\i{}E. hookeriana\\i0{}, which differs in its smaller flowers, more gracile habit, and maybe in flowering time.\u003e","\u003cThis species is very close to \\i{}E. tectorum\\i0{}, from which it primarily differs in being bigger. However, both species co-occur in the West Coast, and no intermediate plants have been seen.\u003e","\u003cThis species has been much confused with \\i{}Elegia juncea\\i0{}. \\i{}E. juncea\\i0{} is a rhizomatous species, which resprouts after fire, while \\i{}E. equisetacea\\i0{} is tufted, and reseeds after fire. In addition, \\i{}E. equisetacea \\i0{} has larger and more striking inflorescences, and the juvenile forms have whorled sterile branches at the nodes. In the past the presence of these branches was taken as diagnostic of the species, but they are not developed in more mature or older plants, which are then mis-identified as \\i{}E. juncea.\\i0{}\u003e","\u003cRelated to \\i{}E. juncea \\i0{}and \\i{}E. vaginulata\\i0{} by the spreading rhizomes, but distinct by the large, solitary flowers in each spathe. It is also easily recognisable by the tightly wrapped around spathes in the female, completely obscuring the flower.\u003e","\u003cDistinct by the long spreading rhizome making clusters of flowers, similar to \\i{}E. galpinii\\i0{}, but different by the smaller plants.\u003e","\u003cThis may be an aberrant form of \\i{}E. asperiflora\\i0{} or \\i{}E. rigida\\i0{}.

The variation should be investigated: it includes very slender-culm species, as well as robust plants.\u003e","\u003cUnique in \\i{}Elegia\\i0{} by the hollow culms, the shape of the inflorescences, almost square in outline, is also distinctive.\u003e","\u003cA very distinct species, largely by the large spathes which turn red as the flowers mature.\u003e","\u003cA very distinctive species, not obviously related to any other species of \\i{}Elegia\\i0{}.

However, even so there is still quite substantial variation in this species. It is not yet possible to unambiguously assign specimens lacking rhizomes to either species. Investigation of a larger sample of complete material might well indicate the presence / absence of spathellae can be used to distinguish between the two species.\u003e","\u003cThe large one-flowered female spikelets are unique in the family. Associated with the peculiar rhizomes and branching culms, the species can always be diagnosed.\u003e","\u003cThis species is probably identical to \\i{}E. aggregata\\i0{}, and the two may well form a facies of \\i{}C. ebracteatum\\i0{} that is found in fire-protected habitats, where the plants grow to a large size.

However, it seems unnecessary at this stage to name the perianth types as distinct forms. A member of Sect.\\i{} Lamprocaulis \\i0{} by its branching culms and persistent sheaths, but differs by the paired, stout styles with the free parts shorter than the stylopodium. It is most similar to \\i{}E. prominens\\i0{}, from which it differs by longer sheaths (30-60 mm vs. 10-15 mm), less branched culms, and longer perianth (2-4 mm vs. 1 mm).\u003e","\u003cClose to \\i{}E. tectorum\\i0{}, forming more or less cylindrical very dark inflorescences, and with small flowers, less than 3 mm long.

In addition, the sheaths are shorter (10-15 mm vs. 30-60 mm long), and the culms are more branched. Ecologically the two species replace each other, with \\i{}E. prominens\\i0{} restricted to coastal sands, and \\i{}E. neesii\\i0{} to mountains and sandstone derived sands.\u003e","\u003cIn its present circumscription a very variable species. It is possible that it might contain several segregates, but there appear to be no obvious characters by which these can be separated. I have separated Pillans\u0027s \\i{}E. amoena\\i0{} again, largely on the absence of rhizomes. \\i{}E. persistens\\i0{} similarly lacks rhizomes, but in addition also has much smaller perianths on the female flowers. The species has in the past been confused with adult forms of \\i{}E. juncea.\\i0{}\u003e","\u003cDistinctive by the spreading rhizomes, with clusters of culms at the nodes. Plants from Malmesbury look very different from those from Potberg.\u003e","\u003cVery closely related to \\i{}E. spathacea\\i0{}, and the boundary between the two species has not been resolved. The typical form differs from \\i{}E. spathacea\\i0{} by the much shorter female bracts, the obtuse to truncate tepals, often with a membranous upper margin, which are shorter than the fruit. This form is found in the northern mountains, around Groot Winterhoek and the Hex River. However, the collections from the Bainskloof area have slightly longer spathes, and the perianth is as in \\i{}E. spathacea\\i0{}. This form has in the past been separated as \\i{}E. spathacea\\i0{} var. \\i{}attenuata\\i0{}, and this might still be a useful solution. The problem with this solution is that the type of \\i{}E. rigida\\i0{} comes from Bainskloof, although it matches the typical form of the species exactly! No such plants have since been collected from Bainskloof. It can readily be distinguished from \\i{}E. filacea\\i0{} by the smaller flowers (perianth less than 1.5 mm long) and the tepals with rounded apices.\u003e","\u003cVery closely related to \\i{}E. rigida\\i0{}, from which it differs by the female bracts longer than 2 cm, and making an almost square, tower-like inflorescence. In addition, the tepals are acute, and overtop the fruit. The typical forms are relatively easy to distinguish, and are also allopatric. However, the material from the geographically intermediate area, around Bains Kloof, cannot be readily assigned to either species. Pillans separated this material as his var. \\i{}attenuata\\i0{}, and this might be a useful solution. Another possible solution might be three subspecies. The complex is in need of critical revision.\u003e","\u003cRelated to \\i{}E. verreauxii\\i0{} by the small stature and rhizomatous growth, but is readily distinghished by the densely spaced culms on the rhizomes.\u003e","\u003cPart of sect. \\i{}Lamprocaulis\\i0{}, distinct by the persistent sheaths and branching culms. Within the section the species is separated by the much-branched habit and two slender styles. The population from Riverlands near Malmesbury (\\i{}Esterhuysen 34630\\i0{}) differs from the normal by the possession of spreading rhizomes. There are also other, difficult to quantify differences in the appearance, and this population could represent a distinct species.\u003e","\u003cUsually included in sect. \\i{}Lamprocaulis\\i0{}, but probably erroneously so.
