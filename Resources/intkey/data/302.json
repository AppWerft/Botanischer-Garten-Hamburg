It is an important edible plant of the arctic, owing to its wide distribution and local abundance. The Inuit eat the leaves fresh or preserve them in seal oil. Caribou, muskoxen, and geese eat the leaves. Arctic hares and lemmings prefer the fleshy rhizomes (Porsild and Cody 1980). \\par{}The Inuit use relatively few plants, and this plant is one of the most important.

Etymologically, it means \"resembling something red\". The flowers, which have a pleasant fresh taste, are often eaten in large quantities when they appear early in the growing season. Too many of the flowers eaten at once can induce diarrhoea. The flowers are good eaten with blubber (Ootoova et al. 2001) or a mixture of seal fat and seal blood (Eva Aariak, personal communication, 2006). The leaves can be used as tea.

The leaves have been used to make tea and were put on cuts. The plants were considered by some to be not good if eaten raw. Others enjoyed them because of their prickliness, but people were advised not to swallow them, unless they had been well chewed first (Mallory and Aiken 2004). \\par{}The plants have been used as bedding for raising husky puppies, as the prickles on the leaves are believed to cause the pads on the feet to toughen up, so that, as adult dogs, they are less likely to need booties when being used to pull komatiks on sea ice (Judith Farrow, personal communication, 1986).\u003e","","","\u003cAn Inuit name \\i{}Suputit\\i0{} means the flowers of willow gone to seed. Other names are \\i{}suputiksaliit\\i0{} and \\i{}uqaujait\\i0{}, which refers to young willow leaves that were eaten with pieces of blubber (Ootoova et al. 2001). \\par{}In abandoned tent sites, or abandoned winter dwellings, once it thawed out it might expose some blubber, which would be rancid, or rendered oil from the blubber would get rancid. By adding some arctic willow you could chew it as you would a gum. If you took the rancid blubber that we had made into gum, then added rendered oil, the colour would turn white like the colour of a caribou back fat. If there were berries, you could add them and make a pudding. The dwarf willow has edible leaves, and its roots can be peeled and bitten to relieve a sore throat. These plants also provide grazing food for muskox and arctic hairs (Rachel Uyarasuk, in Mallory and Aiken 2004).\u003e","","","","","","","","","","\u003cAnderson (1939) noted that this species was used as food in Alaska.

They need to be chopped or chewed to remove the \\i{}itsi\\i0{}, the juice. They could be boiled in water to make a brew for an upset stomach. They could be mixed with \\i{}paunnat\\i0{}, dwarf fireweed. They can be used as bandages and are also delicious to drink as tea (Ootoova et al. 2001). There are tiny white worms that grow in the base of the catkins, and these were eaten along with the plant (S. Nutarakittuq, personal communication, 1990, reported in Mallory and Aiken 2004). The leaves were eaten with seal blood and oil (Eva Aariak, personal communication, 2006).\u003e","","","","","\u003cThe root was gathered as a spring vegetable by Cree and Stone Indians (Barneby 1964) for whom the epithet \u0027aboriginum\u0027 was named.\u003e","","\u003cThe fleshy roots, which in mature plants may be half an inch thick, are edible and when cooked taste somewhat like young carrots (Porsild 1957). They mature in August but may be gathered until the ground freezes. In spring, before the new growth starts, they taste even better than in the autumn, but soon become tough and woody. The root tubers during spring and early summer form the principal food of brown and black bears, and several kinds of meadow mice in autumn harvest store the tubers for winter use. In order to obtain a supply of this much favoured vegetable, the Eskimo of Alaska rob the mice \"caches\" which they locate by means of a dog specially trained for this purpose. Bogoras (1904) reports that this method is also practiced by the Chukchi. \\par{}Andre and Fehr (2000) reported that Gwich\u0027in people use this plant for food and medicine. Although the roots can be dug up at any time when the ground is thawed, the roots are usually collected in June after the river ice breaks up, or from mid-August to September, before freeze-up. They are not suitable for eating between these times because they harden and are too dry to eat. The roots can be stored for the winter with the skin on, as they keep well frozen. The roots are \"just like carrots\". If the root is hard, it is normally boiled. The juice can make a drink that will increase a sick person\u0027s appetite. If eaten raw, the root can relieve diarrhoea.\u003e","","","","","","","","\u003cThe part of the root between the bottom of the stem and the root (caudex) is called \\i{}tuqtaw\\i0{}. The roots can be quite large. They can be eaten raw and have a sweet taste. The roots are yellowish or greenish when they are young. When they are older, they are brownish and more fibrous. They are good for stomach aches and were used to control diarrhoea (Ootoova et al. 2001). The roots are excellent fried in seal oil or store bought oils (Eva Aariak, personal communication, 2006). \\i{}Airait\\i0{} were sucked by babies being carried in \\i{}amautiit\\i0{}.

You would cook the blubber and fry the roots which made them soft. Eating them straight might not be good, but when mixed with blubber they make good eating (Z. Innuksuk, personal communication, reported in Mallory and Aiken 2004). We ate the roots fried in seal fat as soon as the snow melted (Tuqassie Killiktee, personal communication, reported in Mallory and Aiken 2004)\u003e","","","","\u003cInuktutuk names are \\i{}napaaqturalaat\\i0{} (little trees) and \\i{}avaalaqiat\\i0{} (\\i{}avalaqiat\\i0{}). According to Naujamiut, the Inuit from Upernavik, in West Greenland, the word \\i{}avaalaqiat\\i0{} is related to \\i{}avaaq\\i0{} \"back of the head\\rdblquote{} (Paillet 1973). They are used for cooking and for bedding in the Kivalliq area and in Nunavik, and they were used for making fishing spears, \\i{}Kakivaiti\\i0{} (Taamusi Qumaq 1988). \\par{}In the central Canadian Arctic, the dwarf birch was probably used by the Inuit only for firewood. Ptarmigan feed on the buds and catkins, and small passerine birds feed avidly on insects visiting the blooming catkins (Burt 2000). The unfolded birch leaves are sticky on the underside, and children of the Bathurst Inlet area, at least, stick them to their ears and make \"earrings\" of them (Burt 2000). \\par{}Andre and Fehr (2000) reported that Gwich\u0027in people use this plant for flooring in tents and that when placed among spruce boughs, the birch keeps the boughs fresh for a longer period of time. \\par{}Dwarf birch was a useful plant when Inuit were still living mainly on the land. It was their bedding of choice because it did not flatten under a sleeping person. Sometimes because \\i{}avaalaqiat\\i0{} was not available everywhere, women would collect the straight long twigs and tie them together with sinew. They would produce a wonderful bedding mat that could be rolled up easily and simply rolled out. This mat would be taken with them if they needed to move to a new home. Birch was also used as firewood and was a nice flavouring when drying meat. It was easy to make a broom out of birch twigs; pegs were also made to keep the edges of drying skins stretched (Kalluak, Mark, personal communication, reported in Mallory and Aiken 2004).\u003e","","","","","\u003cSome Inuit names are \\i{}malikkaat, isuqtannguat\\i0{}, \\i{}isurramuat, \\i0{}and \\i{}piluit\\i0{}. The word \\i{}malikkaat\\i0{} is used in Panniqtuuq (Pangnirtung), while \\i{}isuqtannguat\\i0{} is used in Kinngait (Cape Dorset). According to their etymology, these plants are called \\i{}malikkaat\\i0{} because they follow the seasons. The word \\i{}isurramuat\\i0{} refers to the fact that they follow the path of the sun. These plants are said to indicate the seasons: when summer is coming they fold out in one direction, and when winter is coming they fold in and twist in the other direction (Ootoova et al. 2001). \\i{}Piluit \\i0{}is the dye and seeds of avens. \\par{}The leaves may be called \\i{}qasilinnait\\i0{}, or \\i{}atungaujat\\i0{}, and may also be known as the plant that numbs the tongue (Ootoova et al. 2001). \\i{}Atungaujat\\i0{} in Iglulik are leaves of mountain avens. In some communities in South Baffin the term is used for grilled mushrooms. In some communities in both North and South Baffin, it refers to leaves that seem to sprout individually right from the ground, are reddish in colour, and shaped like willow leaves. These leaves are known as \\i{}alatsaujat\\i0{} in other communities. \\par{}Mountain avens plants were used to determine the seasons, particularly in the summer. When they are curled tightly it means it is midsummer. As soon as they start to uncoil it is the approach of autumn (Lucien Ukaliannuk, personal communication, in Mallory and Aiken 2004). These plants were called \\i{}mannik\\i0{} in the spring when birds start to lay eggs and \\i{}saggaruut\\i0{} at the next stage when the hairs on the caribou had moulted and been replaced by thin hair. \\i{}Akkulliruut\\i0{} was the name given when the fruits start to uncoil (Michel Krpaaq, personal communication, in Mallory and Aiken 2004). Eva Aariak (personal communication, 2006) noted that the words \\i{}mannik\\i0{}, \\i{}saggaruut\\i0{}, and \\i{}akkulliruut\\i0{} are names of months rather than names applied to this species in particular. When the seed heads are tightly twisted, caribou skins are too thin to make clothing. As the seed heads untwist, caribou skins are suitable for women\u0027s clothing. When the seed heads are fully open, caribou skins are suitable for men\u0027s clothing.\u003e","","","","","","","","","","\u003cThe plants have many different names in their different stages of development. They are known as \\i{}aqpiqutit\\i0{} before the berry forms, \\i{}aqpiksait\\i0{} during the spring before they turn red, and as \\i{}aqpit\\i0{} during the summer. The stems and leaves of the plants are called \\i{}aqpinnaqutit, aqpiputit, or nakait\\i0{} (Ootoova et al. 2001).\\par{}Alaskan natives called this species (and possibly another species of \\i{}Rubus\\i0{}) salmonberries because of the resemblance of the raspberry-like fruits to salmon eggs. Cloudberries growing in the wild are highly valued and a favourite wild fruit of the Inuit. Native peoples often conserve the berries in a frozen state in the snow. The leaves have occasionally been employed as a tea substitute.\\par{}Sir John Richardson (1851, p. 236) noted that the berries are \"perhaps the most delicious of the arctic berries when in perfection, but cloy if eaten in quantity\". Fernald and Kinsey (1943, P. 293) praise them with less reserve, saying, \"the ripe, fresh berries of Baked-Apple eaten without sugar or cream are delicious, but with the addition of these dressing are positively luscious\". The Eskimo, lacking such refinements, serve them in a mixture of seal oil and chewed caribou tallow which has been beaten to a consistency of whipped cream (Porsild 1953).\u003e","\u003cLeaves were used to make a medicinal tea to relieve general stomach ache (Anon 1984)\u003e","\u003cAnderson (1939) noted that in Alaska young shoots of this fireweed were gathered and boiled, usually mixed with \\i{}Rumex\\i0{}. If bacon was added, the dish was said to be delicious. \\par{}People have used fireweed as food. The young shoots have been consumed as greens, the leaves used to make tea, the petals made into jelly, and the roots eaten as a vegetable (Small and Catling 1999). \\par{}Andre and Fehr (2000) reported that Gwich\u0027in people know that the whole plants can be boiled as a medicine and the liquid rubbed on the skin for rashes. A poultice is made from the leaves and applied to burns, bee stings, aches, and swelling caused by arthritis. The pink flowers are edible and can be mixed in with jello and salads. The new shoots can be cooked like asparagus, chopped and eaten as greens, or mixed with salads.\u003e","\u003cThough there is no special season to pick this plant, year-old plants are best (Anon 1984). All parts of the plant (leaves, flowers and seed pods) are edible. They can be eaten raw or mixed with fat, or blood and oil. The leaves are good cooked and taste somewhat like spinach. The flowers of the willow-herb may be eaten raw as a salad, and the fleshy leaves are edible when cooked. The flowers are delicious when mixed with crowberries, blood, and oil. The long seed pod is also edible before it becomes woody. \\par{}These plants can also be used to make tea. The tea is good for stomach aches and to help make a person stronger after they had bled a lot. As well the leaves can be chewed to help stop a nose bleed (George Kappinanq, personal communication, reported in Mallory and Aiken 2004). The whole plant, except the roots, was boiled or chewed to relieve general stomach ache given to people who had intestinal problems to the point where they had blood in their stools if they ate \\i{}amniq\\i0{} (lamp moss). Lamp moss was used to absorb excess acid in the stomach, causing heartburn, but could result in other complications (Ootoova et al. 2001). \\par{}Other uses include fuel for fires and insulation for \\i{}qammait\\i0{} (Ootoova et al. 2001). \\par{}In Greenland, the dwarf fireweed is called \\i{}niviaqsiaq\\i0{}, \"young girl\", and it is the national flower. Also in Greenland, the fresh leaves and the flowers are occasionally eaten raw with seal blubber (Porsild 1953)\u003e","","","","","","","","","","","","\u003cMembers of the genus are called scurvy grass, and the leaves are eaten raw or boiled as an antiscorbutic. The leaves are fleshy, an adaptation that allows them to conserve water within the plant, and the shape of the leaves is responsible for the common name \\lquote{}spoonwort.\\rquote{} The leaves are high in vitamin C, but not particularly tasty. The early sailors and explorers, who overwintered in the Arctic, suffered from scurvy caused by a lack of vitamin C in their diets. They sought the scurvy grass as a dietary supplement. They even boiled it (with poor results) and made a \\ldblquote{}tincture\\rdblquote{} of it (scurvy grass ale) by soaking it in vinegar or alcohol (Schofield 1989). A number of plants were called \"scurvy-grass\", so this name in an early journal does not necessarily refer to this species. \\par{}Porsild (1953) reported that the somewhat peppery flavoured leaves when eaten raw as a salad, or when cooked, are considered a valuable antiscorbutic and as such are mentioned in the narrative of numerous arctic expeditions; but the scurvy grass is not eaten by either Eskimo or Chukchi.\u003e","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\u003cAn Inuit name is \\i{}paurngait\\i0{}, meaning blackberries. Ootoova et al. (2001) reported that the word \\i{}paurngait\\i0{} means \"which looks like \\i{}pauq\\i0{} (soot) because they are black in colour. They are very healthy to eat, juicy, and crunchy. The word \\i{}paurngaqutiti\\i0{} is used for crowberry patches. The berries were recommended for a person who had diarrhoea and are reputedly more effective in hardening watery stools than \\i{}Kigutangirnait\\i0{} (blueberries, bilberries). If you eat a lot of \\i{}Paurngait\\i0{} berries, the stool hardens. It is okay if you eat them with meat, but if you just eat the berries alone you\u0027ll get constipated. They are delicious when mixed with caribou fat. Today \\i{}paurngait\\i0{} are also eaten as jam. As the weather gets colder, crowberries and other berries start to freeze on the ground. When it starts melting again, berries from the year before become visible and can even be eaten then. \\i{}Augujjiaq\\i0{} refers to picking berries with a bowl with holes in it to drain the snow out. The bowl was used as a filter. People would dig in the snow, and put the berries into the bowl. The berries were not dried up. To store the berries, a hole could be made in the sand and some fat poured in. When the fat hardened the berries were put in, and the hole covered with seal skin. After the hole was covered it was further buried for a winter supply. The berries were found to keep very fresh.\" \\par{}Crowberry branches made nice mattresses for \\i{}iqluit\\i0{} (loosely woven summer mattress. Interpretation by N. Hallendy 2003). \\par{}The branches with the leaves attached were used to clean gun barrels (Ootoova et al. 2001). \\par{}The purplish black shiny fruits are very juicy and sweet but contain a number of large, hard seeds (Porsild 1957). \\par{}In Alaska, large numbers of crowberries were picked in late summer and stored in seal oil for use in fall and winter (Ager and Ager 1980). \\par{}Andre and Fehr (2000) noted that the Gwich\u0027in elders reported these berries make good jam and are tasty when eaten alone or when mixed with other berries. They are used to make \\i{}it\u0027suh\\i0{}, a desert prepared from pounded dry fish. (Recipe: take the fish broth from boiled white fish, add a pail of blackberries, enough sugar to sweeten it up, and a dipper of fish blood, heart, and liver. Cook this mixture until it is just like jam.) \\par{}Andrew and Fehr (2000) noted that a tea was made by collecting and boiling the roots, berries, and stems of this plant and that some Gwich\u0027in people considered it as good as spruce gum tea for stomach aches and bad colds. \\par{}Porsild (1950) stated that because of its abundance and hardiness, the crowberry, although not as well flavoured as some other berries, is easily the most important fruit in Arctic regions. \\par{}Rink (1857) claimed that a sparkling white wine may be produced by fermentation of the juice. Berries are used to make wine in Iqaluit (Mary Ellen Thomas, personal communication, 2006). They make a delicious desert when mixed with grated caribou fat, seal fat, and a little water. The mixture is carefully whipped and requires experience to get the best results (Eva Aariak, personal communication, 2006). Suvalik is a similar mixture of the berries with char eggs (Mary Ellen Thomas, personal communication, 2006).\u003e","\u003cAn Inuit name on Baffin and Coral Harbour is \\i{}Kallat\\i0{} for the berries and \\i{}Kallaqutit\\i0{} for a bear berry patch. The berries are eaten by animals, especially bears. The leaves make strong and tasty tea that has a stronger taste than tea made from the leaves of prickly saxifrage. The tea from the leaves does not taste like the mature berries (Ootoova et al. 2001). \\par{}An Inuit name in Nunavik (northern Quebec) is \\i{}kallahutik\\i0{}. Leaves were used to make a medicinal tea to relieve general stomach ache and kidney ailments. Year-old leaves picked in the fall are best (Anon 1984).\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Kublak\\i0{} is the name used on Southampton Island (Aatii Evaloakjuk, personal communication, 2001). \\par{}Andre and Fehr (2000) reported that Gwich\u0027in elders knew that if you did not have water the berries of this plant will quench your thirst. They are also considered good when added to meatballs. \\par{}Porsild (1953) noted that although the berries are eaten greedily by bears and ptarmigan, the berries are unattractive to most people, but according to Fernald and Kinsey (1943, p. 310), \"in the absence of more attractive berries this fruit is apparently wholesome and one soon acquires a taste for it\".\u003e","\u003cSome Inuit call this \\i{}itsutit\\i0{},\\i{} \\i0{}meaning \"fuel for the fire\", or\\i{} plantiksutit,\\i0{} or \\i{}qijuktaat\\i0{},\\i{} \\i0{}meaning \"wood fetched\". Arctic heather has traditionally been used for lighting fires to boil water for tea. The flowers are said to taste awful (Ootoova et al. 2001). \\par{}\\i{}Qammait\\i0{} was the name of Arctic bell heather when it was used to insulate roofs. \\par{}Anderson (1939) indicated that heather was mixed with mosses and lichens to insulate houses in Alaska. A large number of the plants could be wrapped and sewn inside caribou skins and used as a float or a raft that was tippy, but did not sink. They were also used as bed mats, and to dry an \\i{}arrarusiq\\i0{}, a bag made out of the small stomach of a caribou. When the bag was dry, it was used to store lamp moss or sinew (Ootoova et al. 2001).\u003e","","\u003cInuit names for this species are \\i{}qijuktaaqpait\\i0{} (Baffin), meaning \"a large amount of fuel for a fire\" (Ootoova et al. 2001), and \\i{}mamaittuqutiit \\i0{}(Nunavik). \\par{}Medicinal teas are made from the leaves to help general stomach ache, to strengthen a person after much bleeding, and to ease breathing for people with tuberculosis or less serious ailments. Labrador tea leaves may be chewed, placed on the chest, or mixed with seal fat in an ointment and rubbed on the chest (Anon 1984). Inhaling the vapours from the tea helps to clear congested nasal passages. The Inuit of Baffin Island used the stems as a sort of chewing tobacco, and the leaves were put in the smoking mixture. Labrador tea is picked all year round, though it is stronger in fall and winter. \"It doesn\\rquote{}t die but like an animal, such as a dog, it keeps its fur(leaves) all winter. In the spring it develops new fur\". The older the plant the better it is (Anon 1984). \\par{}They are used to treat toothaches and eye disorders. Labrador tea can heal canker sores in the mouth if you place the leaves on them. The stems and leaves could also be boiled for tea and used to treat sore throats. They are also known to moisten very dry hands (Ootoova et al. 2001). \\par{}Anderson (1939) noted that the plant occurred \"all over the tundra\" in Alaska, and at that time, was generally used for tea. \\par{}Andre and Fehr (2000) reported that Gwich\u0027in people picked the leaves and stems all year round for tea and also used the white flowers for tea in the spring. Some people include the root of the plant to make a more concentrated medicinal drink. This muskeg tea is considered good for children and is known to be a relaxant and high in vitamin C. Inhaling the steam from this tea can help clear congested nasal passages. The tea can be made, cooled, and jarred for later use, but elders advise against keeping muskeg tea for more than a few days. Boiling or steeping the tea for more than 10 minutes is not recommended because of some of the chemical compounds it contains change structure and become poisonous (Walker 1984).\\par{}The brown \"fuzz\" on the back of young leaves can be licked and gives a \"buzz\" (Norman Hallendy, personal communication, 2005).\u003e","","","","\u003cAn Inuit name is \\i{}kigutangirnait\\i0{}, which is often shortened to \\i{}naqutit\\i0{} (blueberries). \\i{}Kigutangirnaqutit\\i0{} is the word for a blueberry bush. An unripened blueberry is called a \\i{}nanuq\\i0{}, which means \"a polar bear\". The unripened berries are white. \\i{}Kigutangirnait \\i0{}means \"that which causes the teeth to be removed\\i{}\"\\i0{} because they leave black spots on the teeth. The berries were recommended for a person who had diarrhoea. If you eat a lot of berries, the stool hardens. August is the best month to pick berries. The leaves were used to make tea. They were added to bearberries when there were not enough of them for tea . The branches were used to remove \\i{}puja\\i0{}, gummy blubber, and other stains that ordinary soap could not remove (Ootoova et al. 2001).\\par{}Andre and Fehr (2000) reported that Gwich\u0027in people enjoy eating the berries with sugar in jams, pies, muffins and \\i{}it\u0027suh\\i0{} (a desert made from pounded dry fish. For the recipe, see \\i{}Empetrum\\i0{}). The stems can be boiled to make a tea for cold symptoms. \\par{}Porsild (1953) noted that although Europeans prefer this fruit to that of the crowberry, the bilberry is not much esteemed by Eskimo who believe it is liable to cause dental decay. \\par{}We used to use berries for a pudding in the summer especially when we were staying in a location where they grew. A mix would be prepared with berries and then we could also use \\i{}kigutangirnat\\i0{}, but each type of berries would not be mixed at the same time. One type of berry did not mix well with another type (Z. Innuksuck, personal communication, 1999, reported in Mallory and Aiken, 2004)\u003e","\u003cThe leaves can be used to make tea. The ripe red berries are slightly acidic but tasty and very healthy. Today \\i{}kimminait\\i0{} are used to make jam (Ootoova et al. 2001). \\par{}To ease a sore throat, eat cranberries, raw or boiled (Anon 1984). Cranberries are often used to treat small children who have mouth infections. The berry is squeezed inside the mouth, which hurts a bit, but is effective. Cranberries are also eaten (sometimes boiled) for sore throats and coughing or by sick people who have lost their appetite. \\ldblquote{}It helps you get ready to eat meat again\\rdblquote{}(Anon 1984). \\par{}Cranberries have long been in demand as a food plant. The fruit was prized by Native Americans who used it in many ways, including in pemmican, a dried mixture of animal fat and fruit, which was the precursor of the dehydrated foods used today. Benzoic acid in the berries likely aided in preservation. The Pilgrims, on arriving in the New World, observed cranberries growing profusely in the area about Cape Cod, and noted that the Indians used the fruit as a source of a brilliant red dye for their clothes (Small and Catling 1999). \\par{}Andre and Fehr (2000) reported that Gwich\u0027in people enjoy eating the berries raw or with sugar or added to breads, jams, pies, muffins, and \\i{}it\u0027suh\\i0{} (a desert made from pounded dry fish. For the recipe, see \\i{}Empetrum\\i0{}). Pudding sauce can be made by adding a paste made of flour or custard powder to the boiled berries. \\par{}Andre and Fehr (2000) reported that Gwich\u0027in people used the juice for treating kidney problems. Colds were treated by taking 2-3 cups of cranberry juice made by simmering berries for up to 30 minutes. Such juice also improved digestion and appetite. \\par{}Cranberry juice is good for dyeing porcupine quills (Andre and Fehr 2000). \\par{}Porsild (1953) noted that a very refreshing beverage is made from the diluted, sweetened juice. \\par{}In the past the Inupiaq people would collect the berries in great quantities. They would be eaten mixed with meat, fats, fish eggs, fish, or blubber. Cranberry juice is good for kidney problems, and a tea made from the leaves can relieve a cough. Inupiaq used to keep the berries over winter by storing them in long, shallow birch-bark baskets with a tight lid in an underground pit (Mallory and Aiken 2004)\u003e","","","","","","","","","\u003cAnderson (1939) reported that at that time in some places in Alaska the rootstocks of Lungwort were eaten.\u003e","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\u003cAn Inuit name is \\i{}kukiujait\\i0{}, meaning that which resembles your fingernail. Inuit people call these plants bananas (in English), claiming that the flowers look a bit like that fruit. They eat the corollas after pulling them off the flowers and enjoy their sweet sugary taste (Mallory and Aiken 2004).\u003e","","","","\u003cPorsild (1953) reported that Eskimo children pick the flowers and suck the sweet nectar from the base of the long corolla tube. Porsild (1953) noted that towards maturity the stems elongate, and in the winter often protrude through the snow. The root, which is lemon-yellow and sweet, like young carrot, may be eaten raw or cooked. The flowering stem may be eaten boiled as a potherb. \\par{}The people of Great Slave Region would take small pieces of these roots that were sun-dried and mix them with tobacco. This was then smoked to relieve headaches (Mallory and Aiken 2004).\u003e","","","","","","\u003cAndre and Fehr (2000) reported that the Gwich\u0027in people used this plant for medicine. The whole plant including the flowers can be used to make a tea that relieves coughs and ulcers. A drink that prevents nosebleeds is made by boiling the white flowers in water for a few minutes. The white flowers can be crushed and placed in the nostrils to stop nosebleeds. The liquid from the boiled flowers can be used to soothe infected skin and sunburns, or dry up skin rashes including eczema. A paste made from crushed flowers can be applied to insect bites. Leaves and flowers can also be crushed into a paste and put on wounds to control bleeding.\u003e","","","","","","\u003cBurt (2000) reported that this species is not used by Inuit people living near Bathurst Inlet. \\par{}Andre and Fehr (2000) noted that the Gwich\u0027in people call this plant dandelion and use the flowers to make tea. The Elders say that it is good for some stomach ailments.\u003e","","","","\u003cAndre and Fehr (2000) reported that the Gwich\u0027in people use this plant as a medicine and insect repellent. If the plant is boiled, inhaling the steam will clear nasal passages. Wormwood tea is made for colds and sore throats. Wormwood can be put on a fire to make a strong-smelling smudge that repels mosquitoes.\u003e","","","","","","","","\u003cAnderson (1939) noted that the leaves were gathered as greens, but to a limited extent in Alaska at that time. \\par{}Kjellman (1982) claimed that this plant is a favourite of the Chukchi, who use the mature leaves to prepare a very special variety of \"sauerkraut\". \\par{}Porsild (1957) indicated that the young leaves and flowering stems may be eaten raw as salad or cooked as a potherb. Schofield (1989) and Heller (1985) mentioned that the leaves and flowering stems were used as a food in Alaska and Siberia by local Eskimo groups. \\par{}The leaves have been used by herbalists to make a cough syrup, which is often flavoured with honey. It is said to relieve persistent coughs, bronchial congestions, and asthma (Burt 2000).

In more southern habitats, \\i{}C. saxatilis\\i0{} is almost always associated with shoreline habitats and is absent from surrounding graminoid wetlands.

On disturbed sites around towns in Southern Greenland, plants form dense clumps 30-45 cm high. In the coldest sectors of the Queen Elizabeth Islands, a plant forms a single culm 10-15 cm high in each growing season. The characteristic \"foxtail\" heads can be seen from a low-flying helicopter, and in sparsely vegetated areas on Melville Island, can be used to distinguish relatively dry tundra where it is growing from wetter \\i{}Luzula\\i0{} areas.\u003e","\u003cCulm height in this species appears to be strongly correlated with environmental factors, particularly temperature. Plants growing on the sheltered or sunny side of a rocky outcrop may be conspicuously taller and have more open inflorescences than plants growing in a colder, northfacing adjacent microhabitat. The extent to which the inflorescence opens becomes also appears to be related to environmental factors. Plants with larger more spreading inflorescences occur in known thermal oases, for example, an oasis that has been documented by J. Jacobs, Dept. of Geography, Memorial University, at Burwash Bay, Nettilling Lake, Baffin Island, personal communication, 1986\u003e","\u003cPlant height varies dramatically with different microhabitats. Plants 1-1.5 m tall have been observed in the Mackenzie River delta and in drained lake basins of the Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula, N.W.T.

She observed the same phenomenon at a North Yukon Dew-Line site where the plants with proliferating inflorescences were predominantly growing in the oily tracks left by a heavy vehicle crossing the tundra, while the plants with non-proliferating inflorescences were growing in adjacent less disturbed ground.

There is a short time when the anthers and stigmas are both functional.

Seed-set has been observed several times, in other parts of the world Gabrielsen and Brochmann (1998).\u003e","\u003cWarming (1909) noted that in the flowers, nectar is secreted abundantly from the yellowish green glistening base of the gynoecium. He had observed the species in Greenland to be slightly protandrous. In a recently opened flower, all the stamens are erect or bent somewhat outwards to lie against the petals; but gradually the stamens begin to bend inwards so that the open anthers are placed above the still unripe stigmas. Later the stamens bend backwards, but before they do so the styles have spread outwards and the stigmas have become ripe, with the results that self-pollination may occur. \\par{}Warming (1909) found that the terminal flower in the inflorescence often develops differently from the other flowers. Its styles develop quickly and bend outwards, and the stigmas become highly papillose while the anthers are still entirely closed. These anthers are smaller, never open, and appear to have abnormal pollen, so that the flower is regarded as pistillate with large staminodes. \\par{}Polunin (1940) reported that this species flowers and sets ripe seed in abundance, even in the most northerly and exposed habitats. It is dispersed by wind shaking the seeds out of the capsules\u003e","","\u003cmossy meadows, by brooks and lake shores. Where it is abundant the showy flowers may give a yellow tinge to the tundra. It occurs sparingly on drier areas of open clay. In Greenland, the flowers are strongly protandrous (Warming 1909). Pistillate flowers, and forms showing all the transitional stages between these and the usual flowers, are found on Spitsbergen (Andersson and Hesselman, 1900). Different-sized flies and other \\i{}Diptera\\i0{} have been observed to visit the flowers (Hedberg 1992)\u003e","\u003cJust above tide line (CAN 25877); gneiss, tertiary and coal deposit (CAN 65807); steep slope with carbonate cobbles and boulders, with a moderate amount of fines, on west side of gully (CAN 526885); in fine wet sand below high tide level on gently sloping flats; wet places among coarse boulder litter (CAN 453888); stony, silty diamicton, colluvial, fluvial deposit; growing in moist ground beside a river\u003e","\u003cThe species characterises extensive \\i{}Saxifraga oppositifolia\\i0{} barrens (illustrated in the image library). Plants occasionally grow in moss and in standing water (two observations made at different locations on Ellesmere Island in 1994). \\par{}\\i{}Saxifraga oppositifolia\\i0{} is almost always the earliest \"flower\" to appear in spring, although sometimes some of the willows will be earlier by a day (Polunin 1940). The flowers overwinter in a well-developed condition. In December, in Greenland, petals and stamens were already coloured (Warming 1909). In West Greenland, they have been observed to flower as early as late March. Plants from Svalbard to Novaya Zemlya are reported to have flowers with a strong scent. Nectar is often secreted abundantly from the base of the ovary. Flowers are initially protogynous, and the stigmas mature before the flowers are fully expanded. At first the styles are longer than the stamens, but gradually the anthers become as long as the styles, and gather so closely around them that self-pollination takes place. Functionally staminate flowers occur, the gynoecium very small, with stamens of normal length. Such flowers do not set fruit. Pistillate flowers have been observed. In these, the stamens were almost rudimentary or sterile (Warming 1909). \\par{}Wagner and Tengg (1993) studied the embryogenesis and seed development of \\i{}S. oppositifolia\\i0{} plants growing in northern European mountains. They found that immediately before the flowers open, the ovules are in the post-meiotic state and not ready for fertilisation until the flowers are fully open. After fertilisation, there is a delay of 2-3 weeks before the development of helobial endosperm begins. The differentiation and ripening of the seeds takes a total of 11 weeks.\u003e","\u003cPolunin (1940) noted that this species \"flowers rather sparingly\". Warming (1909) indicated that in Greenland this species flowers relatively late in July and exhibits marked protandry. The terminal flower is the first to open, and there are rarely more than 2 stamens functional at the same time. The styles are at first very small, with the plane surfaces of the stigmas facing each other. As they develop, they spread out. The surface of the stigmas has short club-shaped hairs. Self pollination may take place by the stigmas bending towards the anthers in which there may still be some pollen. Fruit has been observed to ripen in West Greenland\u003e","\u003cSimmons (1906) claimed that the species is usually biennial, whereas Gelting (1934) indicated that it is usually triennial in east Greenland. When the mother plant dies after flowering, the young rosettes are detached and may blow around on snow during the winter, becoming a means of propagation. Simmons (1906) stated that the fruits hardly ever ripen on Ellesmere, and reproduction and dispersal are mainly by vegetative means. Warming (1909) considered the species protandrous, but also that self-pollination is almost inevitable\u003e","","\u003cmostly on gravelly scree slopes\u003e","\u003cThe flowers and the inflorescences droop before opening, but are erect during expansion. Nectar is secreted abundantly by the thick yellow base of the ovary. It is present as small drops even before the anthers open, and the secretion is continued for a very long time, even in old flowers. Protandry occurs, but anthers and stigmas are fertile throughout the greater part of the life of the flower. Self-pollination appears to take place. Fruit has been observed to ripen in West Greenland and the Canadian Arctic. The capsules are stiffly erect and gradually split open with the onset of winter, but the opening remains relatively small. When the wind reaches a certain speed the capsules vibrate, and the seeds gradually shake out. Many seeds are not shed until the winds have packed the snow into a surface as smooth and hard as an asphalt road. Since the seeds are shed only when the wind is blowing strongly, many of them are carried great distances in a single gale (Savile 1968)\u003e","","\u003cForming small thickets, 0.5-3 m tall, in protected places with good winter snow cover.

Populations may be extremely common in open and semi-open habitats of the boreal forest. For example, during the period of maximum flowering over large areas of Alaska, the Yukon, and Quebec (and presumably boreal Europe) plants tend to be so common as to impart a pink colour to large areas of countryside (Shacklette 1964). In the Arctic, individuals are often found in sheltered places in the tundra. In the mountains, they occur in a wide variety of sites: cut and burnt over lands, road cuts, rocky and scree slopes, beside stream, and in alpine meadows. This is particularly true in the northern Yukon.\\par{}\\b{}Breeding Habit.\\b0{} Plants of this species are protandrous and self-incompatible. Pollen is shed soon after anthesis, but the stigma remains closed and strongly reflexed away from the anthers for two or three days. During dehiscence, the pollen is attached to the anther by long threads. Pollination is accomplished by various Hymenoptera, which visit the flowers actively and occasionally by the movement of the stems by wind. After most of the pollen is shed, the stigma comes forward while the anthers become deflexed. The stigma opens and may then be pollinated. Nectar is produced continuously beginning about one day after anthesis and ending with the abscission of the floral parts. In plants growing under greenhouse conditions in the absence of wind or insects, automatic self-pollination nearly always failed to occur, and such plants retained their flowers for a week or longer. \\par{}Salisbury (1961) estimated that each fruiting capsule contains 300-500 seeds and each flowering stem about 80,000, and far greater numbers are not exceptional. Under greenhouse conditions plants readily grow from seed to fruit in about 60 days. Böcher (1962) observed that populations in Greenland are sterile, and Mosquin (1966) claimed that plants at the limits of the distribution range in northern Canada are often unable to reproduce. He suggested that this is undoubtedly very often environmentally induced by the extreme climate. He also claimed there was no evidence that sterility is caused by hybridisation of this species with \\i{}C. angustifolium\\i0{}, as suggested by Forsaith (1916).\u003e","\u003cCommon or even abundant throughout the Arctic in sandy and gravelly, well-watered soils, such as gravel bars or flood plains (Porsild 1957).

The large unglaciated regions of Alaska were probably the main areas from which recolonisation occurred across the Canadian Arctic. The species has aggressive colonising properties and freely invades man-made clearings, roadsides, logged and burnt-over lands, where it may become extremely abundant for many years.

Some of the confusion reflected in the annotations comes about because the inflorescences are pre-anthesis, and in most spikelets there is no evidence of an awn. The top spikelet on one of the inflorescences in collection DAO 106575 is opening and reveals a long callus and a geniculate awn. On the basis of this the \\i{}J.A.

Wynne-Edwards (1937) advanced this ecological explanation in response to the contention by Fernald (1925) that such distributions are the result of the survival of plants on nunataks during glaciation.

The succulent young stems and leaves of the rose-root are edible and may be used as salad or potherb. Where present, the rose-root is generally abundant and provides a palatable and readily available vegetable. \\par{}The names Gold-root and Golden-root have been said to reflect the perceived value of the rootstocks, not their colour. Rose-root is grown in many countries as an ornamental. The young stems and leaves are also sometimes used as wild food, either raw or cooked. The plant is best known for its medicinal properties. It is claimed that the leaves can be used like \\i{}Aloe vera\\i0{} leaves to soothe burns, bites, and other irritation. A paste from the root has been used to help wounds heal. However, the raw root stock sometimes causes allergic reactions. The rootstock of \\i{}R. rosea\\i0{} was often used in European folk love potions. The legendary 13th century Ukrainian prince Danila Galitsky, whose reputation rivalled that of Casanova, was believed to have used Rose-root as an aphrodisiac. In present-day Ukraine, a medicinal alcoholic drink called \\i{}nastojka\\i0{} is prepared by mixing 40% alcohol (e.g., vodka) and an equal weight of rootstock and allowing the mixture to stand for a few weeks. Only a few teaspoons are consumed daily. Russian scientists have written many articles on the pharmacological effects of Rose-root. Experiments with rats have suggested that the chemically active compounds can improve learning and memory and reduce stress. They may also have anti-cancer properties, a stimulating effect on the central nervous system and the effect of protecting the liver. Methods for determining the authenticity and quality of the rhizome are available, as well as methods for quantitative analysis of some of the biologically active compounds. Rose-root was used by the Vikings to give them extra strength for their long, arduous journeys. \\par{}This arctic herb could be cultivated in cold areas of Canada where few other economic plants can be grown without protection.\u003e","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\u003c\\i{}Linum lewisii\\i0{} is in the same genus as commercial flax that is used in the production of linen.

The leaves steeped in ale were highly valued by sailors, perhaps as much for the alcohol as for preventing scurvy. In Scandinavia, scurvy grass sometimes persists around dwellings where in historical times it was planted as a source of vitamin C or for other medicinal purposes (Nordal, personal communication, 2000). Today, it is occasionally cultivated as a culinary herb, and collected also as a wild edible plant. \\par{}Scurvy grass was important historically as a conveniently obtainable green. To a minor extent, northern people in North America and Europe still make use of it today for the same purpose (Szczawinski and Turner 1980). The species has no commercial importance, although it is occasionally sold through seed catalogues. \\par{}Scurvy grass is sometimes grown as a salad plant and potherb with a warm flavor reminiscent of cress, although opinions differ on its palatability. Grieve (1931) characterised the taste as bitter, acrid, tarry, and unappetizing, and Gabriel (1975) stated that it tastes too much like tar to be liked by many people. By contrast, Fernald et al. (1958) described scurvy grass as one of the most agreeable of salads, and Szczawinski and Turner (1980) found it delicious. Michael (1980) wrote that \"it is excellent in salads, and makes the best sandwiches of any wild plant I know, a cross between cucumber and mustard and cress, very cool and juicy. Scurvy grass does not make good tea, it is insipid and slightly salty when drunk as an infusion.\" The opinions expressed above may not simply reflect different personal tastes, but the different tastes of different races of scurvy grass. Nordal (personal communication) observes that in Norway subsp. \\i{}norvegica\\i0{} is milder and tastes better than subsp. \\i{}officinalis\\i0{}. The succulent, slightly salty leaves can be eaten fresh or cooked; the taste of fresh leaves is very pungent. They can be used in tossed green salads like watercress, in sandwiches along with other ingredients, and in soups, sauces, and stuffed vegetables. Michael (1980) recommended that before serving scurvy grass in a salad, it should be soaked in fresh water for at least half an hour, and salt omitted from the salad dressing, as the scurvy grass has enough of its own. The flower-heads are also sometimes eaten like the leaves (Facciola 1990). Scurvy grass is occasionally cultivated in gardens as edible landscaping. \\par{}Michael (1980) has a recipe for Scurvy grass sandwiches. Szczawinski and Turner (1980) have recipes for Scurvy grass salad and Scurvy grass salad with rice (Small 1997). \\par{}Elven (personal communication, 2005) noted that the chemical contents, and thereby the taste, are different in \\i{}C. officinalis\\i0{} and \\i{}C. groenlandica\\i0{}. If the above references are to plants from mainland western Europe north to mainland Norway, they refer to \\i{}C. officinalis\\i0{}. If they are from Iceland, Greenland, or North America, they refer to \\i{}C. groenlandica\\i0{}. Coastal \\i{}C. officinalis\\i0{} is much richer in glycosides than both the fjord plants (\\i{}\u0027norvegica\u0027\\i0{}) and the arctic plants (\\i{}C. groenlandica\\i0{}). This is almost certainly as a defence against grazing (and insects).\\par{}\\b{}Chemistry.\\b0{} The leaves contain a glycoside, butyl mustard oil, a bitter principle, and tannins (Gabriel 1975). The pungent oil contains a sulphide (Grieve 1931). A type of alkyl-glucosinolate (2-butyl glucosinolate, also called glucocochlearin) was found in some northern Scandinavian populations (Nordal et al. 1986). \\par{}\\b{}Medicine \\b0{}Scurvy, a disease marked by spongy gums, loosening of the teeth, and bleeding into the skin and mucous membranes, is caused by a lack of ascorbic acid (vitamin C). Scurvy grass was used a great deal in former times on sea voyages to prevent scurvy. It was considered to be stimulating, a tonic and appetizer, and an agent promoting urine flow, and was also used to treat paralysis and rheumatism (Grieve 1931). \\par{}In France, the medicinal use of scurvy grass became quite popular in 1987, following favourable press reports, and the value increased from US$4.00/kg to $20.00/kg (Verlet 1990). \\par{}\\b{}Nutrition \\b0{}Scurvy grass leaves are quite rich in ascorbic acid, hence the historical use as an antiscorbutic. According to Jacobsen (1994), it also has appreciable vitamin E, and is also rich in minerals, especially manganese. \\par{}In the 1700\u0027s, before the British navy issued lime juice (with limited benefit) to combat scurvy, mariners commonly used scurvy grass to prevent scurvy. Unfortunately, they usually did not appreciate that the benefit was mainly in the fresh herb, and they collected and stowed large bales of dried herb (Angier 1978).\u003e","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\u003c\\i{}Diapensia\\i0{} is not of economic importance as yet.

The industry is in the early stages of development in Canada. It is centred in Newfoundland, but the crop is suitable for many of the northern areas of the country. The market for lingonberries in the United States is very small at present, but likely has very good potential. The fruit has an attractive appearance and interesting taste, and could become a gourmet item in North America.

Its odd morphology has attracted much attention, and resulted in a remarkable number of infraspecific taxa being described. The most extreme treatment has been by Gandoger (1891) who recognised 62 forms. \\par{}These extreme treatments are, in part, due to variation within clones. Hauke (1963) found that, as new stems are continually produced, young stems may have short, simple branches (forma \\i{}varium\\i0{} Milde), but mature branches are long, frequently becoming branched (forma \\i{}pseudo-sylvaticum\\i0{} Milde) and may develop dark teeth (forma \\i{}nigricans\\i0{} Warnst). Also, stems produced when the surrounding vegetation is undeveloped may be low and spreading (forma \\i{}decumbens\\i0{} Meyer). Rapp (1949) illustrated the effect of shifting sand in an Indiana dune on \\i{}E. arvense\\i0{} s.l. where it produced forms \\i{}alpestre\\i0{} Wahlenb., \\i{}diffusum\\i0{} A.A. Eaton ex Gilbert, and \\i{}decumbens\\i0{} Meyer, all on the same rhizome. Schaffner (1928) showed variation on a single plant with respect to branch number. Kato (1964) presented a graph showing that, at least in Japan, the lowermost nodes of a plant bore mostly 4-angled branches, the uppermost, mostly 3-angled. It was suggested that the difference in the number of angles is related to whether the plant is growing in sun or shade. Hauke (1963) suggested that this apparent correlation breaks down when one gets into the Arctic and the shade form disappears, but does it? The image library has a picture of a plant that was growing between rocks at 81°N and was possibly quite shaded. \\par{}One obvious feature of \\i{}E. arvense\\i0{} is the dimorphism between its vegetative and fertile stems. All conditions exist, from fertile stems producing a few branches (var. \\i{}irriguum\\i0{}) to fertile stems resembling the sterile stems. The latter forms are frequent northward, where they are often depauperate (\\i{}E. calderi\\i0{} B. Boivin). \\par{}Hauke (1966) concluded that \\i{}E. arvense\\i0{} is a noteworthy plant in the many different growth forms it can assume, but evidently these are only superficial modifications and none deserves taxonomic recognition. The reliable characters that characterise this species are as follows: rhizomes (including the internodes) felted, branches 3-4 angled, with the first branch internode longer than the subadjacent teeth, stem sheaths slightly longer than they are wide, slightly involute or appressed to the stem, and branch teeth with subulate tips. These characters, plus some internal anatomy characters, differentiate this species from all other taxa and remain essentially constant in spite of various gross plant modifications. \\par{}The physiology of fruiting is not understood. Whatever it is, there is a control mechanism that can be upset. Depending upon when and how it is disrupted, a fertile stem may develop branches, which is not surprising, since dormant branch apices are present. Conversely, a vegetative stem may develop a cone, which is less easily explained, since the shoot apical cell must change its pattern of activity. Occasionally, an apex begins to produce a cone then reverts to vegetative activity, and a proliferated cone is produced (illustrated in Hauke 1963). \\par{}Elven et al. (2005) state that \"there have been many doubts about whether there is a separate arctic-alpine race or only a group of arctic modifications. A race was reluctantly accepted by Øllgaard in Jonsell (2000). Both Tzvelev and Elven tend to accept it as a subspecies, but Elven commented that its reported distribution in European Russia and Siberia seems very large compared with its strict restriction to northern high alpine and clearly arctic areas in northwestern Europe and North America. Schönswetter et al. (2001) argued for acceptance as a separate race, based on several morphological criteria.\" Hauke (1993, \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{} treatment, p. 81) states, \\ldblquote{}Among the many infraspecific taxa that have been named in this species [\\i{}E. arvense\\i0{} \\i{}s.l.\\i0{}], \\i{}E. arvense\\i0{} var. \\i{}boreale\\i0{} (Bong.) Á. Löve, has been most generally accepted and has been applied to plants with tall, erect stems with 3-ridged branches. Because both 3-ridged and 4-ridged branches may occur on a single stem, the variety \\i{}boreale\\i0{} is not recognised here as distinct.\\rdblquote{} Schönswetter et al. (2001) convincingly argued that the name \\i{}\u0027borealis\u0027\\i0{}, more or less uniformly applied for this arctic-alpine race, has been misapplied. It is based on plants from Sitka in southeastern Alaska that differ from the arctic and high alpine plants in most morphological features. The next available name is Wahlenberg\u0027s var. \\i{}alpestre\\i0{}.\\par{}Much of the material in the Flora region aligns with \\i{}E. arvense\\i0{} var. \\i{}alpestre\\i0{}, but further study is required on the North American specimens. Therefore, following Hauke (1993), here we treat this taxon as a species in the broad sense.\\par{}Field horsetail is well known to be a poisonous plant. Hay containing this weed is apparently more dangerous than the plants are when they are growing in pastures. The deaths of many horses, particularly young horses, have been reported to veterinarians, but there is reason to believe that many more losses are unreported (Frankton and Mulligan 1987).\u003e","\u003cPorsild (1957) suggested that this species is probably always sterile in the Canadian Arctic Islands, but fertile specimens have been collected on Southampton, Coats, and Baffin Islands. Cones may mature in summer or they may overwinter and shed spores in the spring. \\par{}A diagnostic difference distinguishing this species from \\i{}E. variegatum\\i0{} is that the base of the plant is strongly papillose (and dull), whereas it is almost smooth and shiny in \\i{}E. variegatum\\i0{}. Very often the stems of \\i{}E. scirpoides\\i0{} are papillose along the ridges, but this may also be observed in \\i{}E. variegatum\\i0{}. The young or undamaged \"teeth\" have attenuated tips that are sometimes sufficiently long to twist, especially at the uppermost node of a stem branch. The stems are perennial and firm in \\i{}E. scirpoides\\i0{}, whereas they are annual and soft in \\i{}E. arvense.\\i0{}\u003e","\u003cThe subspecies that occurs in the Arctic Archipelago is subsp. \\i{}variegatum\\i0{}. Subspecies \\i{}alaskanum\\i0{} occurs on continental North America and is distinguished from subsp. \\i{}variegatum\\i0{} as follows: sheath teeth, erect, with prominent white margins, subsp. \\i{}variegatum\\i0{}; sheath teeth incurved, with obscure margins or all black, subsp. \\i{}alaskanum\\i0{}. \\par{}Arctic floras with Porsild as an author have indicated that this species has 6-8 sheath teeth at each node, which distinguishes it from \\i{}E. scirpoides\\i0{}, which has 3-4 sheath teeth. Hauke (1993, \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{} treatment) indicates that \\i{}E. variegatum\\i0{} may have 3-12 teeth per sheath, in fact overlapping with the values of \\i{}E. scirpoides\\i0{}. According to Hauke (1993) these taxa are distinguished because in \\i{}E. variegatum\\i0{} there are as many ridges to the sheaths as there are teeth, while in \\i{}E. scirpoides\\i0{} there are twice as many ridges as teeth. (The number of ridges can be determined by cutting cross sections of the stem.) \\par{}Some authors claim that Schleicher\u0027s name of 1797 is a nomen nudum and that it was first validated by Weber and Mohr, Deut. Crypt. Gewächse 60: 447. 1807.\\par{}\u003e","","\u003cWagner (1992) reported on the difficulties of determining chromosome numbers in the Lycopodiaceae, which include the fact that the spore mother cells, in general, have very thick walls and they may be full of cytoplasmic granules and oil droplets that take up stain and may be mistaken for chromosomes. Also, the chromosomes, unlike those of most ferns, are commonly of different sizes. She stated that \\i{}H. selago\\i0{} had once been categorised by Manton (1950) as the worst cytological object she had ever encountered. Wagner (1992) published a photomicrograph of \\i{}H. selago\\i0{} at diakineses for the count of 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 134. \\par{}The Panarctic Flora project (Elven et al. 2003) has found that there are two current models for explaining the variation in the \\i{}H. selago\\i0{} species group and that the two approaches are mutually exclusive. European-Russian treatments are based on a hypothesis of gradual divergence of races of which three were proposed as species by Tzvelev in Elven et al. (2003): \\i{}H. selago\\i0{}, \\i{}H. arctica\\i0{}, and \\i{}H. appressa\\i0{}. Northwestern European authors recognise two species (\\i{}H. selago\\i0{}, \\i{}H. arctica)\\i0{} and tend to regard \\i{}H\\i0{}. \\i{}appressa\\i0{} as intermediate between \\i{}selago\\i0{} and \\i{}arctica\\i0{} without its own rank. When this is done \\i{}appressa\\i0{} is included with \\i{}arctica\\i0{}; see, for example, Kukkonen (in Jonsell 2000, Fl. Nord. 1). \\par{}Wagner and Beitel (1993) hypothesise that the variation in the genus \\i{}Huperzia\\i0{} is caused by different combinations of original (diploid) genomes that are present in the different ploidy entities. In their 1992 paper on the generic classification of modern North American Lycopodiaceae they provided a generic classification based on 50 characters of anatomy, chromosomes, spores, and gametophytes, with states that they assigned as either primitive or derived and analysed using the methods of ground-plan-divergence cladistics (Wagner and Wagner 1980). \\par{}Wagner and Beitel (1993) treated the North American entities as species. They considered the taxa were based on two hybridisation groups, the eastern North American one containing \\i{}H. selago\\i0{}, \\i{}H. appalachiana\\i0{}, and their hybrid. They considered \\i{}H. selago\\i0{} s.s. occurs in Temperate \u0027middle\u0027 North American material north to the south shore of Hudson Bay and perhaps northwestern parts of mainland Northwest Territories (also \"Europe, Asia\"). Unfortunately, the majority of the American arctic material from the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, central and northern Greenland, was not included in the treatment (or maps) in Wagner and Beitel (1993). \\par{}The Russian approach is satisfactory in that it includes all arctic plants in some kind of system. It is unsatisfactory because it is not in accordance with the current evolutionary hypothesis for the genus (Holub 1983; Øllgaard 1987; and Wagner and Beitel 1992) and because it treats \\i{}H. miyoshiana \\i0{}as different from the other elements known to be of the same \u0027genomic\u0027 group. The Wagner and Beitel (1993) treatment is unsatisfactory because it is not readily applicable outside North America and because it neglects most of the American arctic plants.\u003e","\u003cIn striking contrast to \\i{}Diphasiastrum\\i0{} and \\i{}Huperzia\\i0{}, interspecific hybridisation is practically unknown in \\i{}Lycopodium\\i0{} (Wagner and Beitel 1993). \\par{}The North American approach (Wagner and Beitel 1993) has been to neglect the variation in \\i{}L. annotinum\\i0{} but to accept the variation in \\i{}L. clavatum\\i0{} at the level of two species. In northwestern European and Russian views, these pairs of species/subspecies are considered comparable. The differences are mainly quantitative in both cases. Elven et al. (2003) chose to recognise subspecies in both cases, suggesting that they are pairs of closely related taxa with south to north distribution (Elven et al. 2003). \\i{}Lycopodium annotinum\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}alpestre\\i0{} is the only taxon of this genus in the flora region.\\par{}Plants intermediate between \\i{}Lycopodium annotinum\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}alpestre \\i0{}and \\i{}L. annotinum\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}annotinum\\i0{} are considered to belong to a form that has been called var. \\i{}pungens\\i0{} (Bachelot de la Pylie) Desvaux. This is an invalid name (Wagner and Beitel 1993).\\par{}\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Cystopteris fragilis\\i0{} occurs at higher latitudes and/or elevations than other species of \\i{}Cystopteris. \\i0{}It is a polymorphic complex, and morphologically distinct hexaploid cytotypes have been reported from disjunct populations in Ontario, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Montana, and Wyoming. Isozymic profiles of each of these populations indicate that the hexaploids are polyphyletic and should not be accorded species status (Haufler et al. 1993). Werth and Windham (1991) suggested that this polymorphic polyploid is probably actively speciating at the tetraploid level, perhaps through gene silencing.\\par{}The presence of verrucate spores (as opposed to the normal spiny spores) has been used to circumscribe \\i{}Cystopteris dickieana\\i0{}. It is possible that the verrucate spore is a recessive feature controlled by one gene, or only a few genes. While present at low frequency in much of the range of \\i{}C. fragilis\\i0{}, verrucate spores are particularly prominent in the Great Plains, and some specimens from the Arctic have been assigned to \\i{}C. dickieana\\i0{}, although there is no agreement on such assignments. \\par{}Elven et al. (2003) discussed the separation of these entities: \"The only consistent feature that separates \\i{}\u0027dickieana\u0027\\i0{} from \\i{}\u0027fragilis\u0027\\i0{} s.s. is the spore ornamentation. In the North Atlantic area there is no connection between this ornamentation and other morphological features, and it is impossible to separate \\i{}\u0027dickieana\u0027\\i0{} on macromorphology. It also occurs more or less occasionally within populations [see, e.g., Berg 1992, and Berg, in Jonsell 2000]. \\i{}Cystopteris dickieana\\i0{} has been finally \u0027killed\u0027 as a taxon by the investigations published by Dyer et al. (2000) [Edinb. J. Bot. 57: 71-81] and Parks et al. (2000) [Edinb. J. Bot. 57: 83-105]. Even if the reticulate spore ornamentation has a certain geographic pattern, this is to be considered as a geographical variation in one character (possibly caused by a single gene), not associated with other characters, and not nearly enough for recognition of a taxon at any level\" .\u003e","","\u003cIsozyme studies confirm the longstanding hypothesis that \\i{}W. alpina\\i0{} is an allotetraploid derived from hybridisation between \\i{}W. glabella\\i0{} and \\i{}W. ilvensis\\i0{} (Windham 1993). Hybrids have been reported both from Europe and North America. These morphologically intermediate triploids with malformed spores have been called \\i{}W. ×gracilis\\i0{} (G. Lawson) Butters.\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Woodsia glabella\\i0{} is a well-marked species in our area. The glabrous, pale yellow-green (straw-coloured) petiole is a good identification characteristic.\u003e","\u003cShade forms, and possibly high-latitude forms, of \\i{}W. ilvensis\\i0{},\\i{} \\i0{}with reduced numbers of scales and hairs, are occasionally misidentified as \\i{}W. alpina\\i0{}. The morphological distinctions between these species are further blurred, at least in the south, by natural hybridisation, which produces the intermediate triploid known as \\i{}W. ×gracilis\\i0{}. Some of the best characters for distinguishing these taxa are spore size and morphology. Spores average less than 46 microns in diameter, in \\i{}W. ilvensis\\i0{}, more than 46 microns in diameter, in \\i{}W. alpina\\i0{}, and are malformed and abortive in the hybrid (F.S. Wagner 1987).\u003e","\u003cThe reasons for placing this species in the family Tofieldiaceae are documented in the notes associated with the family. \\par{}Parker (2002) noted that what appear to be hybrids between \\i{}Tofieldia pusilla\\i0{} and \\i{}T. coccinea \\i0{}occasionally occur in Greenland and the Northwest Territories. They are characterised by a leafy bract at or near the middle of the stem and enlarged, crimson bracts below the pedicels. In some suspected hybrids, the bracts are absent, and fused bracteoles, truncate or lobed, sheathe the pedicels well below the flowers.\\par{}Tanaka (1981) reported that \\i{}T. coccinea\\i0{} var. \\i{}kondoi\\i0{} has small-sized chromosomes and 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 30. Utech (1978) reported on the floral vascular anatomy and floral morphology of \\i{}T. coccinea\\i0{}.\u003e","\u003cThe reasons why this species is placed in the family Tofieldiaceae is documented in the notes associated with the family.\u003e","\u003cHultén (1968) indicated that var. \\i{}borealis\\i0{} has a shorter, more compact spike of greater length than the leaves, low growth, and seems to be merely a growth form and apparently an adaptation to Northern conditions. \\par{}Haynes and Hellquist (2000), in the \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{} treatment, divided the species into three subspecies in North America - subsp. \\i{}filiformis\\i0{}, \\i{}alpina\\i0{}, and \\i{}occidentalis\\i0{} - but their application outside North America is problematic. They consider the \\i{}\u0027alpina\u0027\\i0{} entity (described from Norway) as synonymous with the \\i{}\u0027borealis\u0027\\i0{} entity (described from North America), with priority for the former. Elven et al. (2005) suggested that this synonymisation may be artificial. The \\i{}\u0027alpina\u0027\\i0{} entity is considered by Russian and northwestern European botanists to be just a northern and alpine minor race or modification of the narrow-leaved \\i{}\u0027filiformis\u0027\\i0{}, whereas \\i{}\u0027borealis\u0027\\i0{} seems to be a more significant broad-leaved North American entity. These authors proposed keeping \\i{}\u0027alpina\u0027\\i0{} and \\i{}\u0027borealis\u0027\\i0{} as different taxa and to synonymise the former with subsp. \\i{}filiformis\\i0{}. The main character separating Eurasian and North American plants is leaf width, 0.2-0.4 versus 0.5-0.8 mm (Tzvelev and Elven, personal communication, 2002). \\par{}Haynes and Hellquist (2000) recorded subsp. \\i{}alpina\\i0{} only for North America and Asia, but that is erroneous, as the name has a Norwegian typification. Blytt, who described subsp. \\i{}alpina\\i0{}, referred to material from six sites in southern Norway (Blytt\u0027s annotated specimens are in O), and the type must be chosen among these (Tzvelev and Elven, May 2002, in discussion). \\par{}The \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{} treatment stated that no specimens of this taxon had been seen from Nunavut, but that it is to be expected there (Les and Haynes 1996). Vouchers specimens for the three Nunavut records on the map are housed at CAN. \\par{}Fassett (1940) considers this species to be a good duck food. \\par{}Porsild (1957) stated that plants are usually sterile in the Arctic. They are found in the muddy bottoms of shallow ponds. \\par{}The stipules of \\i{}Stuckenia\\i0{} are adnate to the blade for two-thirds to nearly the entire length of the stipule. The few species of \\i{}Potamogeton\\i0{} with adnate stipules have the adnation less than half the length of the stipule, or less than 4 mm. Submerged leaves of \\i{}Stuckenia\\i0{} are opaque, channelled, and turgid, whereas those of \\i{}Potamogeton\\i0{} are translucent, flat, and without grooves or channels (Les and Haynes 1996).\u003e","\u003cThis orchid is a pinkish brown colour, lacking chlorophyll. It is a saprophyte and gets its nutrients from mycorrhiza on the roots. Because of the complex relationship between the orchid and the environment in which it is growing, this species is almost impossible to transplant and should be left growing where it is found. \\par{}This species was first reported from Baffin Island in 1997 by Joyce Gould (Can. Field-Naturalist, 111: 471-472). She found this species in Auyuittuq National Park, Baffin Island, at two sites in 1995, and prepared a plant voucher from one of them. The specimen was deposited at DAO. \\par{}This species is circumboreal (Hultén 1968) and is known from continental Northwest territories north to treeline (Porsild 1943), Ungava (northern Quebec) (Cayouette 1984), and western Greenland (Hultén 1968). It was not an altogether unexpected find on southeastern Baffin Island (Gould 1997). \\par{}Both of the populations found by Gould (1997) were in fluvial deposits. One population was found on the east side of a river, \"at the base of an end moraine and of a fluvial terrace just south of a small tributary, in a habitat dominated by Arctic willow (\\i{}Salix arctica\\i0{}) and moss (\\i{}Pohlia drummondii\\i0{}), and with \\i{}Arctagrostis latifolia\\i0{}, \\i{}Pyrola grandiflora\\i0{}, \\i{}Poa arctica\\i0{}, \\i{}Persicaria vivipara\\i0{}, \\i{}Pedicularis\\i0{} \\i{}flammea\\i0{}, and \\i{}Carex\\i0{} species\". The second population was found at the base of a colluvial slope, among \\i{}Salix arctica\\i0{}, the moss \\i{}Aulocomnium\\i0{} \\i{}turgidum\\i0{}, and a species of the lichen \\i{}Stereocaulon\\i0{}. Hultén (1968, p. 329) describes its habitat as \"wet places, woods, bogs.\" Scoggan (1978, p. 528) notes the habitat as \"bogs, thickets and woods\", while in the Northwest territories, Porsild and Cody (1980, p. 213) describe the habitat as \"turfy, open places\". \\par{}Magrath and Freudenstein (2002) noted that \\i{}Corallorhiza trifida\\i0{} is largely autogamous, although a syrphid fly (\\i{}Syrphus cinctellus\\i0{}) was reported as a pollinator (Silen 1906). Various floral morphs exist, some with weak geographic corrections; they do not appear to warrant recognition.\u003e","\u003cElven et al. (2003) noted that the most recent North American treatment (Brooks and Clemants 2000) of \\i{}J. arcticus\\i0{} recognised three varieties, two as arctic (var. \\i{}alaskanus\\i0{} and var. \\i{}balticus\\i0{}). Brooks and Clemants (2000) stated that \\i{}J. arcticus\\i0{} is \"a wide-ranging and obviously polymorphic complex that has not read the literature.\" \\par{}\\i{}Juncus arcticus\\i0{} and \\i{}J. balticus\\i0{} were both originally described from northern Europe. In most of this area they are very different in general morphology and in many detailed features. When comparing a series of \u0027typical\u0027 plants, no one would be in doubt about them being two different species. But even in Europe the separation of them as species is now disputed. \\par{}Another problem to be resolved was whether the \\i{}\u0027alaskanus\u0027\\i0{} entity belonged as a race of \\i{}J. arcticus\\i0{} or of \\i{}J. balticus\\i0{}. Brooks and Clemants (2000) included most northern North American (including Greenland) material in their concept of var. a\\i{}laskanus\\i0{}, but they allowed that \"perhaps \\i{}J. arcticus\\i0{} var. \\i{}alaskanus\\i0{} is not distinct from the Eurasian \\i{}J. arcticus\\i0{} var. \\i{}arcticus\\i0{}\". That is certainly the case with much of the Greenland material, which is indistinguishable from the northern European (type area) and Svalbard material. The Alaskan material is more different, but not very much so. The \\i{}\u0027alaskanus\u0027\\i0{} entity is obviously much closer to the Northern European \\i{}\u0027arcticus\u0027\\i0{} entity than it is to the northern European \\i{}\u0027balticus\u0027\\i0{}. \\par{}Elven et al. (2003) considered the options were either to \"regard the entire complex as one large, polymorphic species with 4-5 subspecies, as two species (\\i{}J. arcticus\\i0{} with the \\i{}\u0027arcticus\u0027\\i0{}, \\i{}\u0027alaskanus\u0027\\i0{}, and \\i{}\u0027sitchensis\u0027\\i0{} entities; \\i{}J. balticus\\i0{} with the \\i{}\u0027balticus\u0027\\i0{} and \\i{}\u0027littoralis\u0027\\i0{} entities), or as numerous ill-defined, morphologically overlapping, and probably fully interfertile species.\" The \\i{}\u0027littoralis\u0027\\i0{} race is more southern, ranging from Alaska to Newfoundland, often inland (Porsild and Cody 1980). \\par{}In May, 2005, Elven and Aiken examined CAN specimens from Banks and Victoria Islands and concluded that they belong to subsp. \\i{}arcticus.\\i0{} This was not expected, as subsp. \\i{}arcticus\\i0{} is typified from Scandinavia. Subspecies \\i{}arcticus\\i0{} has relatively delicate plants with small flowers in compact inflorescences; plants of subsp. \\i{}alaskanus\\i0{} are coarse, with diffuse inflorescences (Elven, personal communication, May 2005). Also, Porsild and Cody (1980) had reported \\i{}J. balticus\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}alaskanus\\i0{} Hultén (synonymous with \\i{}J. arcticus\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}alaskanus\\i0{} Hultén) on adjacent continental North America, and also on Victoria and Banks Islands. Elven and Aiken could not separate the specimens collected in the eastern Canadian Arctic Islands on the anther, inflorescence, or capsule characters usually used to recognise separate subspecies. Therefore, currently, subsp. \\i{}arcticus\\i0{} is recognised on the Canadian Arctic Islands.\\par{}Fontenla et al. (2001) studied the mycorrhizal status of plant species in northwestern Patagonia communities representative of Patagonian steppe and marshes including \\i{}Juncus arcticus\\i0{}. \\par{}Cooper and MacDonald (2000) used \\i{}J. arcticus\\i0{} in a revegetation experiment to restore rich fens that had been mined in Colorado. They found that \\i{}Juncus arcticus\\i0{} and willow cuttings had differing patterns of survival with respect to the annual maximum height of the water table and that dominant species can be successfully reintroduced to mined surfaces with the appropriate hydrologic conditions. Cooper and MacDonald (2000) stated that human intervention would be necessary to rapidly re-establish plant cover and that the slow rate of peat accumulation means that restoration of the mined fens will require hundreds, if not thousands, of years.\u003e","\u003cPolunin (1940) noted that this is \"one of the most characteristic of all arctic phanerogams [and varies] little in any features that are of true taxonomic importance. However, in size and robustness it is liable to show great extremes in different habitats almost anywhere within the [eastern Canadian Arctic], varying from 2 to 30 cm in height, with the culms sometimes stout and sometimes very slender. It is also variable in the length and prominence of the \"spathe\" [leaf associated with the inflorescence] that subtends the flowers, this being generally longer in plants growing under favourable conditions, but often varying considerably on different culms coming from the same tuft.\" (p. 146). \\par{}A specimen from Ward Hunt Island, 83°N, at the northern edge of its range, has leaves longer than the flowering stems CAN (234211). \\par{}Danvind and Nilsson (1997) used \\i{}J. biglumis\\i0{} in a study testing the hypothesis that diaspore buoyancy is an important factor in determining the distribution range of riparian plants. The authors measured the floating capacity of fruits and seeds from 17 alpine vascular plant species during one year along the free-flowing Vindelu River in northern Sweden. Minimum, median, mean, and maximum floating times of fruits and seeds were related to the downstream distribution of plants. The distances from the alpine headwater region to the most downstream occurrence of plants, and to the cessation of a more continuous distribution, were evaluated. The variation in downstream limits of plants could not be statistically explained by variation in seed buoyancy between species, indicating that floating ability of seeds is not important for plant distribution patterns. \\par{}Elven et al. (2003) noted that there might be some interesting unexplored variation in this common arctic-alpine species. Both the two main ploidy levels are known from Scandinavia. Most Scandinavian plants seem to differ morphologically from the majority of plants in the Arctic, in size (smaller), and in some other details.\u003e","\u003cBrooks and Clemants (2000) fully synonymised the \\i{}\u0027leucochlamys\u0027\\i0{} entity (\\i{}Juncus castaneus\\i0{} Sm. subsp. \\i{}leucochlamys\\i0{} (Zinger ex V. Krecz.) Hultén) with \\i{}J. castaneus\\i0{}. Hultén first accepted them as species [Hultén 1943: 428] but later changed his opinion to subspecies after investigation of more material (Hultén 1967). Elven et al. (2003) followed Hultén\u0027s later viewpoint, because the taxa had been observed to intergrade in Alaska. They noted that there are plants from eastern Canada (e.g., from southern Baffin Island: Iqaluit) very different from Eurasiatic \\i{}J. castaneus\\i0{} s.s. (Elven, after visiting the island in 1999). \\par{}Hultén (1968) noted that \\i{}J. castaneus\\i0{} var. \\i{}pallidus\\i0{} has pale perianth bracts and capsules, and often has few-flowered heads. It occurs in scattered localities. Polunin (1940) considered this a well-marked colour phase, which occurs only in the south.\\par{}Since Porsild (1957) new records have been collected on Ellesmere Island. \\par{}\u003e","\u003cPolunin (1940) considered this species a \"southern\" type, apparently eking out a rather precarious existence in arctic and alpine regions and sometimes only 5 or 6 cm high, although more often attaining a height of some 15 cm. \\par{}Bayfield (1996), in a study of long-term changes in colonisation of bulldozed ski slopes, found that, generally where grass seeding was done, most local vascular species were more effective colonists of seeded than of untreated ground, but an exception was \\i{}J. trifidus\\i0{}, which was more successful on unsown ground. \\par{}Marchand and Roach (1980), in a study of reproductive strategies of pioneering alpine species seed production, dispersal, and germination, found that \\i{}J. trifidus\\i0{} showed high production of viable seed, high germination percentages, and relatively high (albeit short-range) seed mobility, combining the advantages of perennial longevity with reproductive vigour more typical of annuals. While \\i{}J. trifidus\\i0{} appeared capable of sexual reproduction, successful invasion of disturbed sites was considered probably restricted to fairly local areas where there is a high fallout of seed.\u003e","\u003cPolunin (1940a) noted that this taxon is very common in the extreme south of the flora area but only occasional north of the Arctic Circle, where its place is largely taken by the earlier flowering, and otherwise better adapted, \\i{}J. biglumis\\i0{}. Like that species, with which it is often associated, it grows chiefly in rather open areas of damp mud or clayey soil. Rarely more than 15 cm high, and often only 5-10 cm high, it is easily overlooked except when flowering, and hence rarely to be found in the collections of amateurs even from areas where it is plentiful. The distribution map presented here shows several more records for Ellesmere and Axel Heiberg Islands since Porsild (1957). \\par{}Porsild (1957, 1964) and Porsild and Cody (1980) referred all Canadian populations of \\i{}J. triglumis\\i0{} s.l. (at least east of Mackenzie River), as well as the Greenland populations, to \\i{}J. albescens\\i0{}. Hultén (1968) considered \\i{}J. triglumis\\i0{} s.s. to be circumpolar. \\par{}The reported ploidy difference is an argument for recognition of \\i{}J. triglumis\\i0{} (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 50) and \\i{}J. albescens\\i0{} (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 130 - 134) as species, but the morphological and geographical data are ambiguous. A correlation between ploidy level and morphology is still not well established. Löve and Löve (1956) reported, e.g., both 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 50 and 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d about 134 from Iceland where only \\i{}J. triglumis\\i0{} s.s. is known to occur. At least one of the \\i{}\u0027triglumis\u0027\\i0{}-level counts is North American, disproving a North American (\\i{}albescens\\i0{}) and Eurasian (\\i{}triglumis\\i0{}) disjunction. Elven et al. (2003) favoured subspecific status for the two taxa. Brooks and Clemants (2000) accepted both (as varieties) for North America, largely as sympatric, but with \\i{}\u0027albescens\u0027\\i0{} as the most widespread. If the morphological distinctions are connected to the ploidal levels (this fact is not yet established), the choice is rather between two species or one polymorphic species, and rank as variety or subspecies is then inappropriate (Elven, personal communication, 2005).\\par{}\\i{}Juncus triglumis\\i0{} is often reported as colonising silty disturbed areas, and tends to be locally sparse. It can be found in numerous habitat types, however, and at varying altitudes from coastal swales to upper mountain slopes as high as 1000 feet above sea level (CAN 370914). In tundra meadows, it can be found in \\i{}Carex\\i0{} communities along with \\i{}J. biglumis\\i0{}. In coastal wetlands, it occurs in extensive marshes with \\i{}Eriophorum\\i0{} and \\i{}Carex aquatilis\\i0{} var. \\i{}minor\\i0{}. On black, mucky seepage slopes, it grows with \\i{}Kobresia simpliciuscula\\i0{} and \\i{}Eriophorum callitrix. \\i0{}On southern Baffin Island at Ogac Lake, it was reported in this habitat type with \\i{}Trichophorum cespitosum\\i0{} and \\i{}Pinguicula vulgaris\\i0{} (CAN 302048). \\par{}\\i{}Juncus triglumis\\i0{} was found to be an early coloniser of oil spills in Alaska (Kershaw and Kershaw 1986).\u003e","\u003cThe combination \\i{}L. arcuata\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}confusa\\i0{} was not formally made by Blytt (1861 p. 298), just cited in synonymy with reference to Hartman, but there with sufficient citation of basionym to be considered validly published (Elven et al. 2003). \\par{}Bliss and Svoboda (1984), in a study of soils, plant communities, and net annual plant production in the western Queen Elizabeth Islands, recognised a \\i{}Luzula confusa\\i0{} graminoid steppe that was more productive than a \\i{}Puccinellia\\i0{} barren. Bell and Bliss (1978) estimated that the roots of \\i{}L. confusa\\i0{} live 7-13 years. Addison and Bliss (1984) reported on the adaptations of \\i{}Luzula confusa\\i0{} to a polar semi-desert environment.\\par{}Van der Wal et al. (2000) manipulated the plant phenology of \\i{}Luzula\\i0{} heathland plots in Spitsbergen (78°N) by adding or removing snow, which altered the time for plots (2 m × 2 m; \\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 10) to become snow-free. Nitrogen content of the forage species decreased with time after snowmelt, whereas C:N ratio increased. Manipulation of snowmelt led to a shift in \"phenological time\", without altering these plant quality parameters as such. Early in the growing season, Svalbard reindeer (\\i{}Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus\\i0{}) selected the advanced plots which had been snow-free for longest, presumably because of the greater biomass of both \\i{}Luzula confusa\\i0{} and \\i{}Salix polaris\\i0{}, major components of reindeer diet at that time of the year. Phenolic content did not differ among treatments, and is therefore unlikely to play a role in reindeer selection for plots with early snowmelt. Unlike in temperate regions, where selection for plant quality seems to be of major importance, selection for plant quantity might be an outcome of generally low levels of plant biomass and high forage quality during the growing season in the High Arctic. Reindeer selection for high plant biomass is likely to lead to a more favourable nitrogen and energy return than selection for high plant quality. \\par{}Nakatsubo et al. (1998), as a part of the study on soil carbon flow in a deglaciated area in Svalbard (79°N), estimated the contribution of the belowground respiration of vascular plants, including \\i{}Luzula confusa\\i0{}, to total soil respiration in August 1996. The respiratory activity and the Q10 value of the respiration were higher in \\i{}S. polaris\\i0{} than in the other two species. Total soil respiration rates measured in the field varied widely. The areas with dense vegetation cover tended to show high respiration rates. The contribution of the belowground respiration to total soil respiration was negligible in the early stages of succession. On the other hand, the respiration of the belowground parts contributed to a significant proportion (approx. 29%) of the total soil respiration in the latter stages of succession.\u003e","\u003cJarolimova and Kirschner (1995) studied plants of \\i{}Luzula multiflora\\i0{} s.l. in Ireland from 14 populations that were invariably tetraploid with 2\\i{}n \\i0{}\u003d 24. Chromosomes of the tetraploid are of AL type (true tetraploidy). Meiosis of the tetraploids is of the same type as described for other \\i{}Luzula\\i0{} taxa in the literature. In meiosis, 12 bivalents are regularly formed. A hypothesis, based on the morphological and allozyme data, that the tetraploids are of alloploid origin was supported by the results. Meiosis in an artificial hybrid between the presumed parental taxa, \\i{}L. campestris\\i0{} and \\i{}L. pallidula\\i0{}, was studied, and a tendency towards chromosome doubling was observed. \\par{}Extensive work on this and related taxa has been done in Europe by Kirschner (1990, 1991, 1992, and 1997), Kirschner and Krisa (1980); Kirschner and Rich (1996). \\par{}This taxon was anticipated as occurring on the Arctic Archipelago by Porsild (1957) and reported for Baffin Island, Ogac Lake, and Beekman Peninsula by McLaren (1964). These records do not appear in the \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{} map (Brooks and Clemants 2000). This taxon was collected in 2004 near Ogac Lake, by Aiken and LeBlanc.\u003e","\u003cElven et al. (2003) discussed the use of the name \\i{}L. arctica\\i0{} for this taxon. They noted that \"a number of authors (Hultén 1968, Böcher et al. 1968, Porsild and Cody 1980, Novikov 1990) have considered \\i{}L. nivalis\\i0{} to be conspecific with \\i{}L. arctica\\i0{}, but some of them (Hultén 1968, Böcher et al. 1968) have used the name \\i{}L. arctica\\i0{}, while the others (Porsild and Cody 1980...) [have used] the correct name \\i{}L. nivalis\\i0{}.\" According to Chrtek and Krisa (1980), \\i{}L. arctica\\i0{} and \\i{}L. nivalis\\i0{} are not identical taxa. In 2005, Kirschner and Elven considered the taxa identical (Elven, personal communication) for the following reasons:\\par{}Elven et al. (2003) noted that Nordic and other European authors consider Læstadius\u0027 \\i{}L. campestris\\i0{} var. \\i{}nivalis\\i0{} as corresponding to current \\i{}L. arctica\\i0{}. Elven et al (2003) stated \"The type of Læstadius\u0027 var. \\i{}nivalis\\i0{} ...clearly belongs to the same species as the type of \\i{}L. arctica\\i0{}... and both belong to what we consider as \\i{}L. arctica\\i0{}.\" According to Hylander (1945: 108-109; 1953: 186), and accepted by Swab (2000), Sprengel\u0027s application of the name \u0027\\i{}nivalis\u0027\\i0{} was different from the \u0027\\i{}nivalis\\i0{}\u0027 of Læstadius and did not correspond to the Nordic and arctic plants; Sprengel\u0027s concept was of a central European plant and his description does not fit Læstadius\u0027 var. \\i{}nivalis\\i0{}. Beurling (1853) also explicitly referred to the erroneous usage of Sprengel. If this is the case, Chrtek and Krisa (1980) are right in their comment, since the name \u0027\\i{}nivalis\\i0{}\u0027 would have priority at varietal level but \u0027\\i{}arctica\\i0{}\u0027 at species level. However, Sprengel\u0027s name is indeed based on \\i{}L. campestris\\i0{} (L.) DC. var. \\i{}nivalis\\i0{} Laest. Therefore, by priority, \\i{}Luzula nivalis\\i0{} is considered the correct name, and a lectotypification is being published on a Laestadius collection in S (Kirschner, personal communication). Thus we use the name \\i{}L. nivalis\\i0{}, although Brooks and Clemants (2000) use the name \\i{}L. arctica\\i0{}. \\par{}Polunin (1940) noted that this is one of the most abundant, ubiquitous, and ecologically important of all arctic plants and that it varies considerably if sufficient material is examined. However, the extremes of variation of inflorescence form are linked by plentiful intermediate stages, and because of this and because they concern characters that are of little taxonomic importance elsewhere in the group, they seem hardly worth describing. \\par{}Polunin (1940) referenced specimens that appeared to him to be \\i{}L. arctica\\i0{} × \\i{}L. confusa\\i0{} hybrids. He noted that sheets labelled \"\\i{}L. hyperborea\\i0{} R. Br.\" frequently consist of a mixture of the two species, which is true of Robert Brown\u0027s type sheet in the British Museum, so that it seems best to discard this name altogether. Nobody else appears to have proposed a hybrid between these taxa that appear to be distantly related and without any hybridisation whatsoever. \\par{}Bell and Bliss (1978) estimated that the roots of \\i{}L. nivalis\\i0{} (\\i{}L. arctica\\i0{}) live 7-13 years.\u003e","\u003cPolunin (1940) observed that although this species is very variable elsewhere, it seems relatively constant in the Canadian Arctic, although it varies considerably in size and luxuriance and there is some variation in the numbers of cilia on the bracts. Elven et al. (2003) consider the taxon very homogeneous throughout the Arctic but very heterogenous in more southern temperate mountains. \\par{}Chrtek and Krísa (1962) reported on a taxonomic study of the species \\i{}Luzula\\i0{} \\i{}spicata\\i0{} (L.) D.C. sensu lato in Europe.\\par{}\u003e","\u003cThe only location for this taxon in Greenland (northeast) could be explained by migration from the Eurasian Arctic (Yurtsev, personal communication, 2001).\u003e","\u003cThe \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{} treatment (Standley et al. 2002) states that the species \\i{}C. aquatilis\\i0{} is distinguished by \"amphistomic... papillose leaves, glabrous sheaths with a concave apex, and perigynia that lack veins and are usually brown-spotted in the proximal half, and have glossy achenes,\" and recognises four extensively intergrading varieties. The one that occurs in the Arctic Archipelago, although extensively intergrading along the Arctic coast with var. \\i{}aquatilis\\i0{},\\i{} \\i0{}appears to be distinct, as it has been reported to maintain its distinctive characteristics in cultivation (Cayouette and Morisset 1986). \\par{}The entity that occurs in the Canadian Arctic is called \\i{}C. aquatilis\\i0{} var. \\i{}minor\\i0{} Boott in the \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{} treatment (Standley et al. 2002). Elven et al. (2003) recognise this taxon as subsp. \\i{}stans\\i0{} (Drejer) Hultén, with the comment that \"the division into \\i{}aquatilis\\i0{} and \\i{}stans\\i0{} seems to be made differently in different areas. In Norway and Greenland, and partly in North America, \\i{}\u0027minor\u0027\\i0{} is considered fairly narrowly whereas some Russian floras [Fl. Murm. Obl.] consider it much more widely \u0027stans\u0027. This results in discrepancies at national borders\". If subsp. \\i{}stans\\i0{} is raised to species, the name \\i{}C. concolor\\i0{} R. Br. has priority (Egorova, personal communication, 2002). \\par{}The role of this taxon (as \\i{}C. aquatilis\\i0{} var. \\i{}minor\\i0{}) in methane efflux from boreal peat lands was studied by Pullman et al. (1995). \\par{}In a study of scale-dependent correlations of Arctic vegetation and snow cover in southeastern Victoria Island, Schaefer and Messier (1995) found that this taxon (as \\i{}C. aquatilis\\i0{} var. \\i{}minor\\i0{}) exhibited positive associations with various measures of snow cover. It is thought that snow cover may reduce the rate of desiccation, protect plants from abrasion, and insulate from low temperatures. \\par{}\\i{}Carex aquatilis\\i0{} s.l. is a forage species for lesser snow geese (\\i{}Anser caerulescens\\i0{}). In their study of the nutrient contents of principal forage plants utilised by the geese at La Perouse Bay, Manitoba, Gadallah and Jefferies (1995) show that nutrient content in \\i{}C. aquatilis\\i0{} s.l. is lower than that of \\i{}C. subspathacea\\i0{}, which inhabits salt marshes nearer to the coast. Although the lesser snow goose prefers to forage on \\i{}C. subspathacea\\i0{}, it will feed on the leaf tips of \\i{}C. aquatilis\\i0{} during the summer and on the shoot bases and rhizomes in spring and autumn. \\par{}\\i{}Carex aquatilis\\i0{} was found to be an early coloniser of oil spills in Alaska (Kershaw and Kershaw 1986). \\par{}Ovenden (1986) found \\i{}Carex aquatilis\\i0{} s.l. was an early colonising species on the lake bed of Illisarvik, the site of a thermokarst lake that was artificially drained in August 1978. By 1985, the lake bed was dry in most areas and wind erosion was extensive. Substrate type appeared to have had little influence on distributional patterns of the colonising vegetation. More important factors were probably erosion, surface wetness, and proximity of the lake-bed margin. Other widespread species included \\i{}Tephroseris palustris\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}congesta\\i0{} (\\i{}Senecio congestus\\i0{}), \\i{}Descurainia sophioides\\i0{}, \\i{}Tripleurospermum maritimum\\i0{}, \\i{}Artemisia tilesii\\i0{}, \\i{}Arctophila fulva\\i0{}, and \\i{}Stellaria longipes.\\i0{}\u003e","\u003cA recent investigation based on Scandinavian material (Reinhammer 1999) strongly supported the status of this species as distinct from \\i{}C. capitata\\i0{}. There are consistent differences in genetic markers between \\i{}C. arctogena\\i0{} and \\i{}C. capitata\\i0{}, consistent differences in morphology and ecology, a different distribution pattern (even if overlapping), and not a single documented intermediate or hybrid. Elven et al. (2003) consider they are unambiguously good species both \u0027biologically\u0027 and morphologically. \\par{}Murray (2002) in the \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{} treatment states that although these two species are readily distinguished in Scandinavia and Russia (Reinhammer 1999 and Egorova 1999, respectively) the situation is not as clear in North America. Murray noted that in North America two taxa may be distinguished but there are also numerous specimens of uncertain determination. He included both species under \\i{}C. capitata\\i0{}, but concluded that separate status at some rank may be appropriate for the taxon \"arctogena\" in North America and urged that, when making new collections, it is important to pay close attention to habitat and habit. \\i{}Carex capitata\\i0{} occurs in boreal mires and is mat-forming; the pistillate scales are much shorter and narrower than the perigynia with narrow hyaline margins; the perigynia taper gradually to the glabrous beak. \\i{}Carex arctogena\\i0{} grows in alpine heaths and is tufted; the pistillate scales are as long as the perigynia and with broad hyaline margins; the perigynia have an abrupt beak and may be sparingly serrulate. All specimens of \\i{}C. capitata \\i0{}from the Canadian Arctic Archipelago that we have checked to date have been redetermined as \\i{}C. arctogena\\i0{}.\u003e","\u003cPolunin (1940) noted that this species may be mistaken for a marsh form of \\i{}Carex fuliginosa\\i0{} [as \\i{}C. misandra\\i0{}] and that specimens of the two are sometimes mounted together; upon closer examination they are actually quite distinct. \\par{}In a study of scale-dependent correlations of Arctic vegetation and snow cover in southeastern Victoria Island, Schaefer and Messier (1995) found that \\i{}C. atrofusca\\i0{} exhibited positive associations with various measures of snow cover. It is thought that snow cover may reduce the rate of desiccation, protect plants from abrasion, and insulate them from low temperatures. \\par{}Rare exceptions to the normal morphology are the specimens CAN 23127 and CAN 483451, with two staminate spikes, and CAN 483450, which has a subterminal spike with both staminate and pistillate flowers. \\par{}Ball and Mastrogiuseppe (2002) noted that \\i{}C. atrofusca\\i0{} is the only species in sect. \\i{}Aulocystis \\i0{}with papillose perigynia, suggesting that it is perhaps misplaced. Egorova (1999, in Elven et al. 2003) placed \\i{}C. atrofusca\\i0{} in sect. \\i{}Chartoteuchium\\i0{}.\u003e","\u003cPolunin (1940) described this species as \"a characteristic and attractive little sedge, with more or less pendulous spikes of rounded, pastel-green fruits peeping out from behind dark scales\". He noted that it varies considerably in luxuriance and has culms that arch in all directions.\\par{}\u003e","\u003cThis taxon is widespread and variable in the eastern Arctic, varying from strongly stoloniferous and 10-40 cm high to closely tufted and only 4-5 cm high (Polunin 1940). A form with narrow perigynia and long and stiff peduncles to the lower spikes, is sometimes separated as \\i{}C. anguillata\\i0{}. Polunin (1940) concluded it was best to include this and all other forms in the eastern Arctic under the same name, and this has generally been done. \\par{}McLaren (1964) indicated that \\i{}C. anguillata\\i0{} was an addition to the flora of the Arctic Archipelago. He collected two specimens on Baffin Island at Ogac Lake (specimens at CAN). They are relatively delicate plants but within the concept of \\i{}C. bigelowii\\i0{}. Another specimen, CAN 204794, collected from the head of Clyde Inlet, Baffin Island, was annotated by Porsild (1958) as ?\\i{}C. anguillata\\i0{} (Drejer) Fern; \"a peculiar form in which the terminal spikes are female at most with 1-2 male flowers near the summit\". These document the considerable variation that is known in \\i{}C. bigelowii\\i0{}. Polunin (1940) discussed why the names \\i{}C. concolor\\i0{} R. Br. and \\i{}C. rigida\\i0{} Good. cannot be used. Porsild and Cody (1980) noted that in moist areas the plants become taller and occasionally have longer and more lax-flowered pistillate spikes. \\par{}Chater (1980) noted that this is an extremely variable species whose infraspecific taxonomy is confused by its apparent similarity to small variants of \\i{}Carex aquatilis\\i0{} in the arctic, by the occurrence of numerous hybrids, and by the fact that published work on it has never taken full account of the variation over the entire range. \\par{}\\i{}Carex bigelowii\\i0{} is self-compatible, but protandry limits pollination within flowering shoots (Jonsson et al. 1996). Their study of genetic diversity using allozyme electrophoresis revealed extensive genetic diversity, and indicated high levels of outbreeding in the past. Today, the species produces many seeds and has a large, long-lived seed bank; yet very little seedling recruitment has been observed. In Iceland, seedling recruitment has been observed only in disturbed sites. Reproduction is mainly by vegetative clonal growth (also observed in Swedish Lapland by Wikberg et al. 1994). The long internodes of the rhizomes break down over time, resulting in a large number of independent fragments with the same genetic composition (Jonsson et al. 1996). \\par{}The impact of the anticipated climate changes on the population growth and vegetative spread of \\i{}Carex bigelowii\\i0{} was investigated by Carlsson and Callaghan (1994). They showed that increases in nutrients, carbon dioxide, and temperature (expected consequences of climate change in the Arctic) will lead to increased growth of the species, and that young \"guerrilla\" type tillers will contribute significantly to vegetative spread.\\par{}Demographic aspects in populations of the species were studied in Swedish Lapland by Wikberg et al. (1994) at three altitudes. Tiller densities from the highest altitudes increased significantly during the study period (10-20 years), while those from intermediate and lower altitudes stayed constant. \\par{}Experimental control of flowering was investigated by Heide (1992).\u003e","\u003cStandley et al. (2002) recognised this taxon at the subspecies level in the \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{} treatment and keyed out the two subspecies as follows: \\par{}\"Perigynia green, spotted purple-black on apical half, minutely papillose; stipe 0.15-0.45 mm long, proximal pistillate spike loosely flowered, base often attenuate, less often cuneate... \\i{}C. bigelowii \\i0{}subsp\\i{}. bigelowii. \\par{}\\i0{}Perigynia green, often white at maturity, uniformly purple-brown on apical half, stongly or minutely papillose; stipe 0-0.15 mm long, proximal pistillate spike densely flowered, base cuneate, less often attenuate...\\i{}C. bigelowii\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}lugens\\i0{}.\" (p. 400) \\par{}Standley et al. (2002) note that several floras recognise two species, \\i{}C. lugens\\i0{} and \\i{}C. consimilis, \\i0{}in the western Arctic and that these species have more affinities to eastern Asian taxa than to eastern \\i{}C. bigelowii\\i0{}. \"These treatments usually separate \\i{}C. lugens\\i0{} by the caespitose habit, leaves less than 2 mm wide, and setaceous proximal bract. Careful study of the complex indicates that although there are caespitose and rhizomatous morphs, leaf width, bract width, perigynium size and shape all vary considerably within and between populations and the variation is not correlated with habit. It is not known whether variation in habit is due to genetic differences or merely to plant responses to differences in substrate and soil moisture. Long-rhizomatous plants tend to occur in dry tundra, and short-rhizomatous plants tend to occur in wet, peaty muskeg. For that reason, the group is recognised as a single taxon that needs further study.\\rdblquote\\par{}Elven (personal communication, 2005) noted that some initial AFLP data (Schönswetter, unpublished) support the fact that \\i{}C. lugens\\i0{} should be included in \\i{}C. bigelowii\\i0{} s.l., preferably as a subspecies, but that it also should include several Eurasian entities described as species and subspecies by Russians. \\par{}Schaefer and Messier (1995), in a study of scale-dependent correlations of arctic vegetation and snow cover in southeastern Victoria Island, found that \\i{}C. bigelowii\\i0{} exhibited positive associations with various measures of snow cover. It is thought that snow cover may reduce the rate of desiccation, protect plants from abrasion, and insulate them from low temperatures.\u003e","\u003cPorsild (1957) noted that \\i{}C. capillaris\\i0{} s.l. is a very variable species and distinguished between var. \\i{}capillaris\\i0{} s.s. and var. \\i{}major\\i0{} both in the Arctic Archipelago. He dismissed var. \\i{}elongata\\i0{} as not occurring in the area. \\i{}Carex capillaris\\i0{} var. \\i{}major\\i0{} appears to be just a larger form from more sheltered locations and probably has no genetic basis (P. Ball, personal communication, 1998). The \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{} treatment (Ball, 2002, p. 476) indicates that \\i{}C. capillaris\\i0{} \\ldblquote{}is somewhat variable and is often divided into two infraspecific taxa. Plants from the south are larger, have pale brown pistillate scales, and serrulate perigynium beaks. Northern plants are smaller, have medium brown pistillate scales, and smooth perigynium beaks. These characteristics are only weakly correlated making it difficult to assign individuals to these taxa except in a very arbitrary manner.\"\\par{}We recognise the plants in the flora region as \\i{}C. capillaris\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}fuscidula\\i0{} as the taxon is currently treated in the Panarctic Flora checklist (Elven et al. 2003). \\i{}Carex capillaris\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}capillaris\\i0{} of boreal and temperate European and Russia is characterised by having a long-stalked apical male spike, usually emerging above the female spikes, and pale brown perigynia. The northern arctic plants are all characterised by having a short-stalked apical male spike, situated level with, or below, the female spikes, and chestnut brown perigynia, making the female spikes much darker than in subsp. \\i{}capillaris\\i0{}. The name subsp. \\i{}fuscidula\\i0{} belongs to this entity. It is circumpolar and is the one currently documented from the Canadian Arctic Archipelago area. Boreal to southern arctic plants in Southern Greenland, Canada, Alaska, and probably eastern Asia are more difficult to separate from European subsp. \\i{}capillaris\\i0{} but have been named as subsp. \\i{}chlorostachys\\i0{}. A renewed analysis on a worldwide base is urgently needed. \\par{}Although the \\i{}C. capillaris\\i0{} aggregate includes \\i{}C. krausei\\i0{} (Elven et al. 2003), these authors report that specimens from North Greenland and Arctic Canada that they have examined separate fairly cleanly into \\i{}C. fuscidula\\i0{} and \\i{}C. krausei\\i0{}, both of which are described in this Flora\\i{}.\\i0{}\u003e","\u003cPolunin (1940) considered the characteristic habitat of this sedge to be the margins of freshwater pools in sheltered lowland areas where it creeps with conspicuous long stolons on the surface of the wet mud from which the frequent culms arise. Polunin had observed many of the stolons extending out into the water, sometimes for nearly a metre, but in such cases they were barren. Susan Aiken collected this species growing in a wetland area behind the Nunavut Research Institute (Iqaluit) in 1986 and on the beach near the graveyard in 1986 but was not able to find it in 1998, after the wetland area was partially drained and the beach worked with heavy machinery.\u003e","\u003cPolunin (1940) considered this \"one of the most familiar and ubiquitous of all arctic sedges....varies [in the eastern North American Arctic] in height from 4 to 40 cm, but the the existence even in the far north of occasional quite large individuals suggests that the reduction elsewhere is merely the result of local exposure and other conditions\" (pp. 125-126). \\par{}The \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{} treatment (Ball and Mastrogiuseppe 2002, p. 479) noted that \\ldblquote{}Dietrich (1967) recognised two subspecies in the alpine and arctic regions of Europe, \\i{}C. fuliginosa\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}fuliginosa\\i0{} Schkuhr from the mountains of central Europe with leaves about half as long as the fertile stems and spikes 15-20(-25) mm long, and subsp. \\i{}misandra\\i0{}, from northern Europe, with leaves not more than one third as long as the fertile stems and spikes 10-15 mm long. The North American populations have traditionally been places in subsp. \\i{}misandra\\i0{}, but in North America many small plants with short spikes have culms scarcely exceeding the leaves; plants with long spikes have the leaves not more than a quarter the length of the culms.\\rdblquote\\par{}\u003e","\u003cPolunin (1940, p. 120) noted that this is \"yet another little sedge that has been in the past, and probably is to this day, repeatedly missed\". \\par{}In the \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{} treatment (Ball and Murray 2002), this species and \\i{}C. supina \\i0{}are placed in sect. \\i{}Lamprochlaenae,\\i0{} but circumscription of this section has varied. Ball and Murray (2002) noted that Mackenzie (1931-1935, pp. 182) placed \\i{}C. glacialis\\i0{} and \\i{}C. supina\\i0{} in sect. \\i{}Petraeae\\i0{} (sect. \\i{}Rupestres\\i0{}) although no other author has associated these species with unispicate species. The circumscription in \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{} followed that proposed by Egorova (1999).\u003e","\u003cThe taxon that occurs in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago is subsp. \\i{}glareosa \\i0{}(Toivonen 2002). It has leaves 1-2 mm wide and pistillate scales 2-3 mm long. Subspecies \\i{}pribylovensis\\i0{} that has leaves 1.5-2.5 mm wide and pistillate scales 2.7-3.5 mm long is known only from the Pribilof and Aleutian islands and is relatively rare.\\par{}Halliday and Chater (1969a) examined fruit shape in the circumpolar \\i{}C. glareosa\\i0{} complex and concluded there is continuous variation between the long, fusiform fruits of \\i{}C. glareosa\\i0{} and the broad fruits of plants which are referred either to \\i{}C. marina\\i0{} or \\i{}C. glareosa\\i0{} var. \\i{}amphigena\\i0{} Fernald. They indicated that the species \\i{}C. glareosa\\i0{} and \\i{}C. lachenalii\\i0{} Schkuhr are fairly closely related. \\i{}Carex lachenalii\\i0{} is a species of freshwater mires and snow patches, but in east Greenland it often occurs by the seashore where poorly developed individuals may very closely resemble \\i{}C. glareosa\\i0{}. By contrast, \\i{}C. glareosa\\i0{} is nearly always maritime growing in the Arctic with \\i{}C. subspathacea\\i0{}, \\i{}C. ursina\\i0{}, \\i{}Puccinellia phryganodes\\i0{}, and \\i{}Stellaria humifusa\\i0{}. \\par{}Halliday and Chater (1969a) gave the following characters for separating \\i{}C. glareosa\\i0{} from \\i{}C. lachenalii\\i0{}: \\i{}Carex glareosa\\i0{} plants have leaves with stomata on both surfaces, whereas \\i{}C. lachenalii\\i0{} plants have stomata on the lower surface only. In \\i{}C. glareosa\\i0{} the lateral spikes are entirely pistillate, while those of \\i{}C. lachenalii\\i0{} have staminate flowers at the base. The fruits of \\i{}C. glareosa\\i0{} are seldom distinctly beaked, concolorus, and they may vary from brown to pale, whitish green. The fruits of \\i{}C. lachenalii\\i0{} are distinctly beaked, dark brown, and often tinged with green. The leaves are inrolled and filiform in \\i{}C. glareosa\\i0{}, almost flat in \\i{}C. lachenalii.\\i0{} The culms are curved and deposit the fruits on the ground in \\i{}C. glareosa\\i0{}, oblique and straight in \\i{}C. lachenalii\\i0{}.\\par{}Porsild (1957) and Halliday and Chater (1969a) recognised the North American taxon as \\i{}C. glareosa\\i0{} var. \\i{}amphigena\\i0{} Fernald. In the Flora of North America treatment (Toivonen 2002), this variety is synonymised under \\i{}C. glareosa\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}glareosa\\i0{} but is discussed as a variety dominating in North America. \\par{}Porsild (1957) mapped records from Victoria and Ellesmere Islands, but these have not been confirmed.\u003e","\u003cPolunin (1940) noted that this sedge varies greatly in appearance according to the stage of development of the fruits, which seem to be produced in relatively small numbers. \\par{}Porsild (1957) mapped one record from Kimmirut. Since then a collection from Isortoq River (69° 56\u0027N, 76° 50\u0027W) is a significant extension of the known range. This suggests the species should be looked for at other locations on Baffin Island. \\par{}Cochrane (2002) noted that opinions differ about the taxonomic rank of this taxon, which is from North America and Siberia. He suggests that since it is only weakly distinguished from the the Eurasian \\i{}C. dioica\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}dioica\\i0{}, perhaps it is better segregated as \\i{}Carex dioica\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}gynocrates\\i0{} as treated by Hultén (1962). The Eurasian taxon has chromosome counts of 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 52 and 60, and tends to be less strongly dioecious, with paler pistillate scales and ventrally more convex perigynia. \\par{}\\i{}Carex\\i0{} ×\\i{}langeana, \\i0{}the hybrid between \\i{}C. gynocrates\\i0{} and \\i{}C maritima\\i0{}, might be looked for where the two species co-occur. (Cochrane 2002, p 301) notes that \\i{}C. \\i0×\\i{}langeana\\i0{} [\u003d\\i{}C. dutillyi\\i0{} O\u0027Neill and Duncan] \"strongly resembles \\i{}C. maritima\\i0{}; the leaves are slightly scabrous-roughened toward the apex; the heads are smaller, ellipsoid to ovoid-oblong and only 3-5 mm thick; the perigynia are appressed-ascending and more or less flat; and the achenes are not well developed. \\i{}Carex\\i0{} \\i×langeana \\i0{}is reported as forming close turf on dry, peaty limestone barrens in Newfoundland (M.L. Fernald 1933, 1950) and as occasional upon humid rocks and coastal fens along Hudson Bay (J. Deshaye and J. Cayouette 1988). The hybrid should be expected where the parents coexist and has been reported from some of those areas (J. Cayouette and P.M. Catling 1992)\" .\u003e","\u003cPolunin (1940) noted that this taxon was frequently classified as a variety of \\i{}C. norvegica,\\i0{} but in the field it is entirely distinct and he had seen no transitional forms. \\par{}Murray (2002) noted that \\i{}C. holostoma\\i0{} has most likely been overlooked and has a more continuous range than indicated.\u003e","\u003cPolunin (1940) noted that most plants of this species in the eastern arctic varied between 5 and 15 cm in height and recognised those that are much smaller, less than 3 cm in height, as f. \\i{}minima\\i0{} (Beck) Kükenthal. He found plants on Southampton Island with the branches of the inflorescence more lastingly erect than in the typical form, and the pistillate spikes bearing generally more numerous and more densely clustered flowers, and he named these specimens var. \\i{}porsildiana\\i0{} Polunin. Neither name has been widely taken up. \\par{}Ball (2002, p. 476) stated that \\ldblquote{}the status of \\i{}C. krausei\\i0{} is far from clear, and many authors have treated it as a variant of \\i{}C. capillaris\\i0{}. None of the morphologic characters by which they are distinguished appear to be reliable, and the relationship between chromosome number and morphology is based on examination of relatively few populations. The relationship is further confounded by \\i{}C. boecheriana\\i0{} Á. Löve, D. Löve and Raymond, which is morphologically similar to \\i{}C. krausei\\i0{} but cytologically closer to \\i{}C. capillaris\\i0{}. There is no evidence of an ecologic difference between \\i{}C. capillaris\\i0{} and \\i{}C. krausei\\i0{} across its range; \\i{}C. krausei\\i0{} appears to be sympatric with \\i{}C. capillaris.\\i0\\rdblquote\\par{}Elven et al. (2003) considered that \\i{}C. krausei\\i0{} is easily recognised by its bisexual apical spike (female at apex, male at base) and by its more numerous and well-separated female spikes, which when fully developed are long-linear (and not elliptic-ovate as in \\i{}C. capillaris\\i0{}). The dull brown colour of the bracts and perigynia also differs from the colours of races of \\i{}C. capillaris\\i0{}. Löve et al. (1957) separated several taxa within \\i{}C. krausei\\i0{} as considered here, mainly based on ploidy differences. The assignment of chromosome numbers to taxa is still very uncertain. \\par{}Subspecies \\i{}krausei\\i0{} is widely amphi-Beringian (Russian Siberia, Russian Far East, Alaska, and Canada). Subspecies \\i{}porsildiana\\i0{} occurs in the amphi-Atlantic areas (Iceland, Norway, Canada, and Greenland). Subspecies \\i{}robustior\\i0{} is reported for the Yukon Territory (Porsild and Cody 1980). If the taxon is divided, plants from Alaska-Yukon and Central Canada would be probably classified as \\i{}C. krausei\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}krausei\\i0{}; those from the West Hudson Bay area and Baffin-Labrador area probably referred to \\i{}C. krausei\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}porsildiana\\i0{}; and those from Greenland to the latter taxon or to \\i{}C. boecheriana.\\i0\\par{}\u003e","\u003cPolunin (1940) discusses the name of this taxon that he called \\i{}Carex bipartita\\i0{} All. He agreed with Gelting (1934) who considered the familiar salt marsh \\i{}C. glareosa\\i0{} as a variety of this species and recognised it as \\i{}C. bipartita\\i0{} var. \\i{}glareosa\\i0{} (Wahlenb.) Polunin. However, he admitted that seashore plants and individuals occurring away from the shore are referable to a rather variable typical form, and many individuals are intermediate in such characters as the width of the leaves, thickness and rigidity of the culms, and shape of the inflorescence. \\par{}Toivonen (2002) reported that \\ldblquote\\i{}C. lachenalii\\i0{} shows a great deal of morphological variation; \\u8230\\\u002785 most of the variation has no evident taxonomic relevance\\u8230\\\u002785\" The name \\i{}Carex bipartita\\i0{} All. has been widely used for the plant in North America. Toivonen (2002) gave reasons why this name should have priority over \\i{}C. lachenalii\\i0{}. However, the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN) has conserved \\i{}Carex lachenalii\\i0{} over \\i{}C. tripartita\\i0{} (Greuter et al. 2000) and rejected \\i{}C. bipartita\\i0{} (McNeill et al. 2006).\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Carex marina\\i0{} was described by Dewey (1836) from material collected in the Canadian Arctic by Richardson, probably on the second of Franklin\\rquote{}s expeditions. Fernald (1902), like Kükenthal (1909), considered Dewey\\rquote{}s plant to be \\i{}C. heleonastes\\i0{}. Porsild (1957) treated this taxon as \\i{}Carex amblyorhyncha\\i0{} V. Krecz. Halliday and Chater (1969c) showed that \\i{}C. marina\\i0{} is the earlier name of this taxon. \\par{}The species referred to by Mackenzie (1935) as \\i{}C. marina \\i0{}is actually \\i{}C. glareosa\\i0{} Wahlenb. \\par{}Halliday and Chater (1969a) suggested that in the past the widespread \\i{}C. marina\\i0{} hybridised with the more local \\i{}C. glareosa\\i0{} until the latter no longer occurred in pure populations. Elven (personal communication, 2005) stated that he had seen no specimens indicating this hybridisation.\\par{}Toivonen (2002, p. 316-317) in the \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{} treatment noted that \"plants from Greenland and Europe often with two spikes and short-beaked perigynia have been called \\i{}C. marina\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}pseudolagopina\\i0{} (Sørensen) Böcher; subsp. \\i{}marina\\i0{} from North America and Siberia [and also a very small area in western Greenland, around Disko Island] differs in having usually (2-)3(-4) spikes equal in size.... narrower leaves, and a more distinct beak.\" The occurrence of subsp. \\i{}pseudolagopina\\i0{} from North America (excluding Greenland) remains to be fully documented.\u003e","\u003cPolunin (1940) observed that this species varies so much, especially in vegetative characters, that a number of varieties and forms have been erected, and while he did not feel these were appropriate, as there are all stages of gradation from one to another, he recognised one \"phase\" as \\i{}C. maritima\\i0{} f. \\i{}inflata\\i0{} (Simmons) Polunin. He also felt that there was one variety (which even if it is a mere reduction phase) that was so strikingly different in its extreme depauperation and generally High Arctic habitat from the robust plant of the south that he separated it as \\i{}C. maritima\\i0{} var. \\i{}setina\\i0{} (Christ) Fernald. This has not been taken up here. Photographs in the image library illustrate some of the range of variation we have recorded. \\par{}Reznicek (2002, p. 310) indicated that \\i{}C. maritima\\i0{} \"is an extremely widespread and variable species. On exposed headlands, plants can be very tiny in contrast to robust individuals on richer river shores or some inland lakeshores. Very small plants with extremely narrow leaves from coastal regions of Newfoundland have been named \\i{}C. maritima\\i0{} var. \\i{}setina\\i0{}, and unusually large plants from the shores of Kluane Lake, Yukon Territory, have been named \\i{}C. maritima\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}yukonensis\\i0{}. These are both regarded as environmentally derived, representing two extremes in the variation.\"\u003e","\u003cFord and Ball (1992, p. 634) noted that this species is \"the most restricted of all the short-beaked taxa [in section \\i{}Vesicariae\\i0{}], being confined primarily to the North American Arctic. It is noticeably absent from Greenland and occurs in Eurasia only in the Chukot Peninsula and Koryakskiy Mountain region of extreme eastern U.S.S.R. [Russia]. It is one of the few truly northern species of sedge, being widespread in the Arctic Archipelago and occurring in the south as far as northern British Columbia, the southern boundary of the Northwest Territories and northern Quebec. Although this species is said to occur in the Churchill, Manitoba region (Johnson 1987, Porsild and Cody 1980),\" no specimen has been found to support this suggestion. \\par{}Ford and Ball (1992) noted that anatomically \\i{}C. saxatilis\\i0{} is indistinguishable from \\i{}C. membranacea\\i0{} and presented evidence to suggest that \"this similarity is the result of homoplasy or stasis in anatomical characters rather than an indication of a close evolutionary relationship.\" (p. 620). \\par{}\\i{}Carex membranacea\\i0{} was found to be an early coloniser of oil spills in Alaska (Kershaw and Kershaw 1986).\u003e","\u003cSince Porsild (1957), one specimen (CAN 485156) was collected on Victoria Island at Holman, which is a considerable range extension. \\par{}Reznicek (1990) illustrated the rachilla of \\i{}C. microglochin\\i0{} and noted that it is very large, but only one-veined. It is terete and smooth. Internally, surrounding the single central vascular strand is a thick layer of spongy parenchyma, making the rachilla a relatively soft, more or less easily bent structure. It is a striking contrast to the rachillas in other species that he studied. \\par{}Cochrane (2002, p. 531) noted that \"\\i{}Carex michroglochin\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}microglochin\\i0{} is usually rare to occasional in subarctic North America and scattered in the Cordilleran region. It can be locally abundant (e.g., Brooks Range, Alaska) or even dominant (e.g., western Newfoundland) despite its very spotty geographic range... \\i{}Carex michroglochin\\i0{} subsp.\\i{} microglochin\\i0{} is an inconspicuous but interesting little plant, distinctive in having a well-developed rachilla very similar in appearance to the exserted style of \\i{}C. pauciflora\\i0{} Lightfoot. The long pointed perigynia, which mature quickly and detach easily, are probably dispersed by animals (Fernald 1926; Savile 1972).\"\u003e","\u003cIn the vegetative state this species may be difficult to distinguished from \\i{}Kobresia myosuroides\\i0{}. \\par{}Polunin (1940) discusses why he considered specimens in the eastern Arctic to be var. \\i{}hepburnii\\i0{} (Boott) Kükenthal, but recognition of the variety has not been widely taken up in North America. Polunin (1940) had observed the species in Arctic Bay, Baffin Island, where it dominated the slightly damp but by no means sheltered lower slopes around the head of the bay. Plants there were growing sometimes a full 20 cm high, and looked far more luxuriant than any typical \\i{}C. nardina\\i0{}. \\par{}Porsild (1957) indicated that the species was represented in the Canadian Arctic \\ldblquote{}by the eastern race, var. \\i{}atriceps\\i0{} Kükenthal and distinguished from var. \\i{}nardina\\i0{} by its taller growth and less curved culms and leaves\\rdblquote{}. This is no longer considered to be a recognisable entity (P. Ball, University of Toronto, personal communication, 1997). \\par{}Murray (2002), in \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{}, reported that \"much has been written about variation in \\i{}Carex nardina\\i0{}, but little has been resolved. Russian taxonomists have long maintained that \\i{}C. nardina\\i0{} is a species restricted to Iceland, Svalbard, Norway, and Sweden and is distinct at the rank of species from \\i{}C. hepburnii\\i0{} (T.V. Egorova 1999). The differences between perigynia, cited by Egorova and well illustrated in Cronquist (1969), can define two taxa which have been viewed as minor variations (Hultén 1958) or good species. The Scandinavian material does appear to constitute a single taxon \\i{}C. nardina\\i0{}.\" \\par{}Murray (2002) considers that although the clear geographic limits designated by Porsild (1943) are not found, both forms are found in North America, differing as follows (key derived from Murray 2002):\\par{}Perigynia shape: ovate or spindle-shaped; size (3-)3.5-5 × 1.4-1.6 mm; beak formation and size: gradually formed, 0.5 mm, obscure to 0.4 mm; stipe formation and size: distinct, 0.5-1 mm... \\b\\i{}C. nardina\\b0\\i0\\par{}Perigynia shape: obovate or broadly elliptic, size 3-5 × 1.5-2 mm; beak formation and size: obscure to 0.4 mm; stipe formation and size obscure, less than 0.2 mm...\\b\\i{}C. hepburnii\\b0\\i0{}. \\par{}Recorded by S. Aiken from herbarium specimens collected in the Arctic islands before the possibility of \\i{}C. hepburnii\\i0{} was known:\\par{}Perigynia shape: broadly ovate: size 3.3-3.7 × 1.4-1.7 mm; beaked with a short beak; contracted at the base into a stipe-like structure. The data suggest the taxon described is closer to \\i{}C. nardina\\i0{}. \\par{}David Murray (personal communication, June 2001), after examining specimens together with Aiken in Stockholm, 2001, noted that both \\i{}C. nardina\\i0{} and \\i{}C. hepburnii\\i0{} occur in North America. The problem requires further study, especially among specimens collected from northern Quebec and southern Baffin Island. These overlapped in the characters traditionally used to distinguish the subspecies. \\par{}Egorova (1999) and Elven et al. (2003) considered unresolved as to whether \\i{}C. nardina\\i0{} s.s. (excluding \\i{}\u0027hepburnii\u0027\\i0{}) is a narrow North Atlantic entity (Iceland, Northern Scandinavia) or whether it also occurs in North America and elsewhere in the Arctic. If the narrow concept is followed, the plants in the CAFF (Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna) area become \\i{}C. nardina\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}hepburnii\\i0{} (Boott) Á. Löve, D. Löve, and B.M. Kapoor, Arct. Alp. Res. 3, 2: 145. 1971. They represent a major geographical race (the most major one). The \\i{}\u0027hepburnii\u0027\\i0{} entity is typified from Canada: Rocky Mountains, leg. Drummond, type in K. \\par{}Subspecies have not been recognised in this treatment because of the overlapping characters observed in specimens form the eastern Arctic islands.\u003e","\u003cPolunin (1940) noted that except in height this species varies little if at all within the eastern North American Arctic. \\par{}Elven et al. (2003) noted that there might be characters other than the margin of the utricles to justify recognising subsp. \\i{}inserrulata\\i0{}, for example, the width of hyaline margin of bracts, and if so it might represent a distinct taxon (subspecies). The distribution pattern as presented by Hultén and Fries (1986) might support a separation of subspecies: (i) \\i{}\u0027norvegica\u0027\\i0{} in Europe and southeastern Greenland, (ii) \\i{}\u0027inserrulata\u0027\\i0{} in eastern and western Greenland and northeastern North America (the few scattered reports from northwestern North America should be very critically checked), and (iii) \\i{}\u0027conicorostrata\u0027\\i0{} extremely isolated in Chukotka. \\par{}Murray (2002) noted that \\i{}C. norvegica\\i0{} is an amphi-Atlantic species. He treated \\i{}C. norvegica\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}inserrulata\\i0{} as synonymous in the \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{} treatment but noted that some differences can be seen between subsp. \\i{}inserrulata \\i0{}in Greenland and subsp. \\i{}norvegica\\i0{} in northern Europe, and further study is warranted.\\par{}\u003e","\u003cBall and Zoladz (1994) studied the taxonomy of \\i{}C. petricosa\\i0{} and related species in North America, \\i{}C. franklinii\\i0{}, and \\i{}C. misandroides\\i0{}. In a morphological study of herbarium specimens, the multivariate analyses they used failed to adequately differentiate the taxa and led to the conclusion that all should be treated as a single species. The western and eastern populations differed in the proportion of flowers that were distigmatic. Western plants were mostly tristigmatic or had not more than 50% distigmatic flowers. Eastern plants were mostly distigmatic or had more than 50% distigmatic flowers. Consequently, two varieties were recognised in \\i{}C. petricosa\\i0{}, var. \\i{}petricosa\\i0{} from the west and var. \\i{}misandroides\\i0{} (Fernald) B. Boivin from the east (Newfoundland, Quebec, but not in the Arctic islands). Elven et al. (2003) also recognised two varieties. \\par{}Egorova (1999) accepted \\i{}Carex franklinii\\i0{} as a species (in a list of non-Russian species of the section), as did Hultén (1968), Porsild and Cody (1980), and Cody (1996). \\par{}Ball commented that \\i{}Carex franklinii\\i0{} Boott, often considered as a separate species (e.g., by Hultén 1968a, Porsild and Cody 1980, and Cody 1996), is a synonym of \\i{}C. petricosa\\i0{} Dewey s.s. \\i{}Carex petricosa\\i0{} seems to represent small high-altitude plants, whereas \\i{}C. franklinii\\i0{} seems to represent larger plants from a lower altitude. There is ample material collected from the type area (Alberta), which illustrates the full range of variation.\\par{}Ball and Mastrogiuseppe (2002) distinguished varieties in this taxon with the following key (p. 478): \\par{}\"Stigmas 3; achenes trigonous in at least half of the pistillate flowers and fruits... \\i{}C. petricosa\\i0{} var. \\i{}petricosa\\par{}\\i0{}Stigmas 2; achenes biconvex in at least half of the pistillate flowers and fruits...\\i{}C. petricosa\\i0{} var. \\i{}misandroides\\i0{}\". \\par{}The record from the Canadian Arctic Archipelago is assigned to \\i{}C. petricosa\\i0{} var. \\i{}petricosa\\i0{}. The distribution of \\i{}C. petricosa\\i0{} var. \\i{}misandroides\\i0{} is limestone barrens and shores, in Newfoundland Labrador and Quebec.\u003e","\u003cPolunin (1940, p. 127) noted that this species varies considerably in the length of the pedicels, \"even the lowest of which may be so short [less than 1 cm long] and rigid as to hold the spike erect instead of pendulous, and so constitute f. \\i{}erecta\\i0{} Polunin. The species also varies in the colour of the scales, which, except along the midrib, are generally of such a dark brown as to appear jet-black in the field; but they can be of almost any shade to quite a pale brown... This occurrence of forms with light-coloured scales in species that normally have them dark is almost general in this and closely related groups.\" \\par{}Vellend and Waterway (1999), in a study of geographic patterns of genetic diversity for \\i{}C. rariflora\\i0{}, sampled from the east coast of James Bay, interior Nouveau-Québec, and the northern Yukon Territory. They found that within-population diversity was low overall, and that the degree of population differentiation was high. Particularly low levels of genetic variation at James Bay are attributed to founder events following postglacial colonisation. Higher genetic variation in the northern Yukon is attributed to the presence of glacial refugia during the Pleistocene.\u003e","\u003cPolunin (1940) considered this taxon relatively common and noted that it varies considerably in size according to the local conditions, but not in any character that is of taxonomic importance. \\par{}In a study of scale-dependent correlations of Arctic vegetation and snow cover in southeastern Victoria Island, Schaefer and Messier (1995) found that \\i{}C. rupestris\\i0{} was associated with low snow cover.\u003e","\u003cIn a study of the circumpolar short-beaked taxa of \\i{}Carex\\i0{} sect. \\i{}Vesicariae\\i0{}, using numerical analyses of macro-morphological characters, Ford and Ball (1992, p. 620) found that \"within the \\i{}C. saxatilis\\i0{} complex, plants from western North America (\\i{}C. physocarpa\\i0{}) tend to be robust individuals with long peduncles on the pistillate spikes, wide leaves, and large perigynia. These characters, and others, decrease in size eastward across the North American continent, with intermediate plants usually referred to as \\i{}C. saxatilis\\i0{} and small plants referred to as \\i{}C. miliaris\\i0{}.\" Ford and Ball (1992) concluded that a single distigmatic species, \\i{}C. saxatilis\\i0{}, should be recognised and present alternative theories for this clinal variation. They noted that anatomically \\i{}C. saxatilis\\i0{} is indistinguishable from \\i{}C. membranacea\\i0{} and presented evidence to suggest that \"this similarity is the result of homoplasy or stasis in anatomical characters rather than an indication of a close evolutionary relationship.\" (p. 620).\\par{}Elven et al. (2003) considered this an intricate species where perhaps there are three major races or subspecies: \"subsp. \\i{}saxatilis\\i0{} as a mainly boreal-alpine entity in Iceland and mainland Northern Europe, subsp. \\i{}laxa\\i0{} as an arctic circumpolar entity, and perhaps subsp. \\i{}miliaris/rhomalea\\i0{} as one or two boreal to Low Arctic entities in northeastern North America and southern Greenland. The southern and northern Greenland plants are very different and must represent different taxa, subspecies or perhaps species. The southern Greenland entity (\\i{}\u0027miliaris\u0027\\i0{}) also extends into the southern arctic parts of northeastern North America, but perhaps not westwards. The northern Greenland plants are identical with the northern North American, Svalbard, and northern Russian plants (e.g., Novaya Zemlya), i.e., subsp. \\i{}laxa\\i0{}, and different from the mainland European plants, subsp. \\i{}saxatilis\\i0{}.\" If this is the case the problem is how to treat the northeastern America and southern Greenland plants. These authors suggest the solution is to keep \\i{}C. miliaris\\i0{} as a species. \\par{}The chromosome counts listed by Löve and Löve (1975) and Löve (1981d) under the name \\i{}C. miliaris\\i0{}, if reliable, are an additional argument for status as species. (Elven et al. 2003).\u003e","\u003cPolunin (1940) indicated that this species varies greatly in height, from 5 to 30 cm, in the shape of the spike (which may be subglobose to elongate), and in the presence or absence of a cauline leaf (which may be as much as 6 cm long and overtop the spike). He noted that while several forms and varieties had been recognised they were so inconsistent as to be not worth taking up. \\par{}There has been a significant range extension north to Ellesmere Island since Porsild (1957). \\par{}Ouellet and Boutin (1994), in a study of the response of vegetation to simulated grazing and browsing of plants available to caribou in the arctic, found that nitrogen, magnesium, potassium, and phosphorus levels in re-growth plants were above the maximum obtained from ungrazed control plants at any point during the growing season and suggested that grazing changes possibly enhance the quality of these plants as food for herbivores. \\par{}In a study of scale-dependent correlations of Arctic vegetation and snow cover in southeastern Victoria Island, Schaefer and Messier (1995) found that \\i{}C. scirpoidea\\i0{} exhibited positive associations with various measures of snow cover. It is thought that snow cover may reduce the rate of desiccation, protect plants from abrasion, and insulate them from low temperatures. \\par{}\\i{}Carex scirpoidea\\i0{} was found to be an early coloniser of oil spills in Alaska (Kershaw and Kershaw 1986). \\par{}Dunlop (2002), in the \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{} treatment, recognises four races as subspecies. The one occurring in the Arctic Archipelago is subsp. \\i{}scirpoidea\\i0{}, which is recognised by \"the lack of persistent leaf bases on the flowering shoots, ovate perigynia that are tightly enveloped by the perigynia on all sides, and leaves widely V-shaped in transverse section.\" (p. 551). It is widespread from the Russian Far East throughout North America and Greenland to northern Norway. He also recognised three others as segregates within the range of subsp. \\i{}scirpoidea\\i0{}. One of these, the Cordilleran subsp. \\i{}stenochlaena\\i0{}, reaches the Arctic in northwestern North America and is perhaps the most common race there.\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Carex subspathacea\\i0{} is a preferred forage species for lesser snow geese (\\i{}Anser caerulescens\\i0{}) along with \\i{}Puccinellia phryganodes\\i0{}. Gadallah and Jefferies (1995) analysed the nutrient content of these two species at La Perouse Bay, Manitoba, and found them to be higher than those of other salt marsh graminoids. \\par{}Seed set in this taxon is variable. This is a species that requires open ground to flower and set seeds. In areas with such conditions, that is, areas of very low covering and with low companion species, \\i{}C. subspathacea\\i0{} will flower heavily and the seed set is good to very good, the achenes are well formed, but not fertile. In other areas where individual plants are crowded, most of the population seems sterile and vegetative (J. Cayouette, personal communication, March 2002). \\par{}In more boreal areas \\i{}C. subspathacea\\i0{} is mainly an opportunist occupying gaps and other disturbed sites. \\par{}On Arctic islands, \\i{}C. subspathacea\\i0{} has its own established position on the arctic seashores where it occupies a zone between \\i{}Puccinellia phryganodes\\i0{}, closer to the sea, and a grass zone on higher ground. \\par{}Standley et al. (2002), in the \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{} treatment, noted that \\i{}C. subspathacea\\i0{} \"is evidently, with \\i{}C. rufina\\i0{}, the smallest species of sect. \\i{}Phacocystis\\i0{}. Larger plants with one to two staminate spikes and some bisexual spikes frequently occur in Ungava Bay, Hudson Bay, Northwest Territories, and Alaska, but their perigynium and achene characteristics are typical of those in \\i{}C. subspathacea.\\i0{}\" (p. 382). \\par{}Among the several hybrids recognised, the ones that should be looked for in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago are \\i{}Carex \\i0×\\i{}flavicans \\i0{}F.

Recently, sect. \\i{}Lamprochlaenae\\i0{} has been recognised, although circumscription of this section has varied.

T.V. Egorova (1999) recognised both \\i{}C. saltuensis\\i0{} and \\i{}C. vaginata\\i0{}, the latter with two subspecies, in North America. More research is clearly needed on this complex circumpolar entity. The inclusion of \\i{}C. vaginata\\i0{} in sect. \\i{}Paniceae \\i0{}is uncertain.

Porsild and Cody (1980) mapped records from southern Baffin Island. Four collections from Baffin Island, Iqaluit, have been made since Porsild (1957). It occurs in the tundra of Hudson Bay coast and in the field may be mistaken for \\i{}C. krausei.\\par{}\\i0{}Peter Ball (personal communication, Nov. 2004) noted that in the material he had seen this species is often staminate and only sometimes androgynous. He questioned whether these are really androgynous spikes or whether they are a staminate terminal spike with the distal lateral spike reduced to a single perigynium. Occasionally, there is more than one perigynium. He noted also that \\i{}C. williamsii \\i0{}is unlike \\i{}C. capillaris\\i0{} s.l. in which plants with gynecandrous spikes show up erratically in the Rockies in Alberta, and in Greenland sometimes you get staminate and gynecandrous spikes on the same collection and less often on the same plant. Gynecandrous spikes are very uncommon in Canada, but they seem quite common in Greenland.\u003e","\u003cPolunin (1940) noted that this plant was first found in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago at Kimmirut in 1936, submersed in small freshwater ponds in marshy lowland areas a few miles inland. It has since been found in Iqaluit. In the Arctic Archipelago, as is usually the case in Greenland, the plants are submersed and entirely sterile. \\par{}\\i{}Eleocharis acicularis\\i0{} is abundant and ecologically important throughout much of its southern range. Submerged, usually non-flowering plants have been distinguished as formas, e.g., forma \\i{}inundata\\i0{} Svenson, forma \\i{}submersa\\i0{} (Nilsson) Norman. \"The culms of the submerged plants are terete, smooth, soft to flaccid, translucent and the partitions of the air cavities within are clearly visible... Much of the variation is apparently due to phenotypic plasticity in response to environmental factors, especially water depth...The named varieties intergrade extensively, and achenes, which are important in defining varieties, are often absent...Most plants from the Arctic to cool-temperate North America...have culms cylindrical or three- to four-angled; leaf sheaths mostly obscure and closely sheathing; and achenes about two times longer than wide.\" (Smith 2002, pp. 109). Polunin (1940) suggested that these submerged plants might be recognised as \\i{}E. acicularis\\i0{} f. \\i{}submersa\\i0{} (H. Nilss.) Norman, but taxonomic recognition is not appropriate, as the plants are merely the underwater form.They are similar to the type that was described from Europe.\u003e","\u003cThe earliest name for this taxon is \\i{}E. polystachion.\\i0{} Polunin (1940) gave three reasons for rejecting this name. This rejection was proposed by Turland (1997) and formally accepted by McNeill et al. (2006). \\par{}The status of \u0027\\i{}triste\u0027\\i0{} as a species or subspecies was discussed by Novoselova in Elven et al. (2003). Elven et al. (2003) also note that a somewhat \"quixotic argument\" for treating \\i{}E. triste\\i0{} as a species is its \u0027hybridisation pattern\u0027. The hybrid entity \\i{}E. ×sorenseni\\i0{} (\\i{}E. scheuchzeri\\i0{} × \\i{}E. triste\\i0{}) seems to occur in most areas where \\i{}E. triste\\i0{} occurs. No hybrid has been documented between \\i{}E. angustifolium\\i0{} s.s. and \\i{}E. scheuchzeri\\i0{} in spite of their very frequent co-occurrence. \\par{}Novoselova reports that \\i{}E. angustifolium\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}triste\\i0{} differs from \\i{}E. angustifolium\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}angustifolium\\i0{} in the following: \"uppermost leaf sheath funnel-shaped (not cylindrical); peduncle scabrous, up to 2 cm long (not drooping, smooth, up to 5-10 cm long); flowering spikes ovoid to almost spherical (not oblong-ovoid or oblong-elliptical); fruiting heads obovoid (not bell-shaped or narrowly bell-shaped); scales blackish and without whitish margins (not brownish grey, greyish, reddish or ferrugineous with white margins); anthers (1.8-)2.5-2.8(-3) mm long (not (2.5-)3-4(-5) mm long); achenes widely obovoid, 2-2.5 mm long (not oblong-obovoid or oblong-elliptical (2.5-)2.8-3(-3.5) mm long); and chromosome number 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 60 (not 58).\" \\par{}These characters should be enough for specific recognition, but the characters are not always clear-cut on herbarium specimens. In Svalbard (from where \u0027\\i{}triste\\i0{}\u0027 was described) it is very distinct, as it is in Northern Greenland and Ellesmere Island, but there are problems with recognising it elsewhere in Arctic Canada and Alaska. Peter Ball (personal communication, 2005) has stated it is not possible to distinguish the subspecies on the basis of a single character. In the arctic most plants are small, with dense scabridity on all sides of the peduncles, but even there, there are a few populations with essentially glabrous peduncles and others with much reduced scabridity. Southwards the scabridity is reduced and the plants are larger. \\ldblquote{}I cannot recall seeing any collections from the mainland which match the High Arctic \\i{}triste\\i0{} in all characters. Usually the scabridity is restricted to one side of the peduncle and is less dense. Plants like this show up erratically as far south as the north shore of the St. Lawrence, but these plants in all other characters are indistinguishable from subsp. \\i{}angustifolium\\i0{}. I took a very conservative view of subsp. \\i{}trist\\i0{}e in FNA (\\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{}; Ball and Wujek 2002)) excluding most of the intermediate types\\rdblquote{} (Peter Ball, personal communication, 2005).\\par{}Given the uncertainty about reliable characters in the Canadian Arctic and the number of intermediate specimens that have been found to date, further study of this species is required. Therefore, here we include all specimens under \\i{}E. angustifolium \\i0{}s.l.\\par{}A study of the effects of variable soil oxygen and nutrient availability on \\i{}E. angustifolium\\i0{} and \\i{}E. vaginatum\\i0{} was done by Gebauer et al. (1995) near Toolik Lake, Alaska. It was shown that growth in \\i{}E. angustifolium\\i0{} was improved by soil anoxia, and that biomass allocation among plant parts was not significantly affected, indicating that the species is well adapted to flooded, wet habitat. \\par{}In a study of scale-dependent correlations of arctic vegetation and snow cover in southeastern Victoria Island, Schaefer and Messier (1995) found that \\i{}E. angustifolium\\i0{} exhibited positive associations with various measures of snow cover. It is thought that snow cover may reduce the rate of desiccation, protect plants from abrasion, and insulate from low temperatures during the winter season. \\par{}Lutz (1996) showed that photo-inhibition occurs in plants when cold temperatures and high light levels cause free-radical formation and subsequent destruction of the photosynthetic membranes. In his study of this phenomenon in high alpine populations of \\i{}E. angustifolium\\i0{} in Tirol, Austria, he showed that the species avoids this hazard by delaying the development of the photosynthetic apparatus until temperature conditions are favourable. Only etiolated leaves are formed early in the season. When photosynthetic membranes do appear they are protected by a set of carotenoids and antioxidants. \\par{}Ferland and Rochefort (1997) reported that \\i{}E. angustifolium\\i0{} has a positive effect on the survival of peat mosses during the restoration of ombrotrophic peat-lands at Maisonnette, New Brunswick. It is easily transplanted and propagated, and is the companion species that leads to the best recolonisation of \\i{}Sphagnum\\i0{} diaspores. \\par{}\\i{}Eriophorum angustifolium\\i0{} was found to be an early coloniser of oil spills in Alaska (Kershaw and Kershaw 1986).\u003e","\u003cThere is a new distribution record for this taxon occurring on Victoria Island since Porsild (1957).\u003e","","\u003cCayouette (2004) noted that \"this nothosubspecies is currently known only in northeastern Canada, from continental Nunavut... Baffin and Southampton islands...to northern Quebec...Since the sympatric range of the two parental taxa covers large parts of the Nunavut and Northwest Territories, the western Canadian provinces, Alaska, and eastern to western parts of Russia, \\i{}E. ×medium\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}album\\i0{} is likely to be discovered in some of these major areas.\" However, Cayouette (2004) indicated that no specimen outside of northeastern Canada was known to Novoselova in 2004. Cayouette also stated that there was \"the slight possibility that the taxon described from Alaska as \\i{}E. russeolum\\i0{} var. \\i{}albidum\\i0{} by Nylander (1846:10) and bearing \\ldblquote{}narrowly lanceolate scales\\rdblquote{} could refer to the new nothosubspecies, but the type should be searched for and examined.\" Cayoutte (2004) noted that \"some paratypes of \\i{}E. ×medium\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}album\\i0{} have been seen with good mature achenes, indicating that subsp. \\i{}album\\i0{} has perhaps become a stabilised orthospecies of hybrid origin in some areas.\" (pp 808-809).\u003e","\u003cBall and Wujek (2002) referred to this taxon under the name \\i{}E. chamissonis\\i0{} C.A. Meyer and place \\i{}E. russeolum\\i0{} var. \\i{}leucothrix\\i0{} (Blomgren) Hultén in synonymy with it. Novoselova (1993) discussed the question of the identity of \\i{}E. chamissonis\\i0{} C.A. Meyer, drawing attention to the several points of view in the literature concerning the possible use of the name \\i{}E. chamissonis\\i0{} and its restrictions. \\par{}Novoselova (in Elven et al. 2003) considers \\i{}E. russeolum\\i0{} to be a species separate from \\i{}E. chamissonis\\i0{}. The taxon that we have in North America is \\i{}E. russeolum\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}leiocarpum.\\i0\\par{}Novoselova (in Elven et al. 2003) stated that subspecies \\i{}leiocarpum\\i0{} differs from subsp. \\i{}russeolum\\i0{} in \"(i) shorter culms (height (14-)20-30(-35) cm versus 15-80 cm); (ii) fruiting heads white or cream coloured (not different shades of ferrugineous or red); (iii) scales dark grey to black (not grey to dark grey); (iv) anthers shorter (length (0.7-)1-2(-3) mm versus (1.5-)2-3 mm); and (v) achenes glabrate or with very few spicules at apex (not with numerous spicules at apex, rarely glabrate).\"\\par{}Cayouette (2004, p. 805) noted that \"\\i{}Eriophorum russeolum\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}leiocarpum\\i0{} is quite variable, and some specimens can be considered merely as white-coloured counterparts to orange-brown \\i{}E. russeolum. \\i0{}Nevertheless, the spikelets of this subspecies tend to be more often ellipsoid than obovoid, the achenes more often obovoid than ellipsoid, and the achene beaks narrower on average than in subsp. This variation is encountered in all parts of subsp. \\i{}leiocarpum\\i0{}\u0027s North American range\\i{}.\\i0{} Specimens from higher latitudes (e.g., Nunavut) tend to have more blackish medial scales, but all other characters are within the variation of the subspecies.\"\u003e","\u003cPolunin (1940, pp. 98-99) commented that in the eastern Canadian Arctic \"this species varies so much in the length of the anthers and the width of the white margin to the involucral scales that it is sometimes difficult to distinguish from specimens of the generally more slender \\i{}E. chamissonis\\i0{} f. \\i{}albidum\\i0{} [in this treatment \u003d \\i{}E. russeolum\\i0{}]... the shape of the head is apt to be misleading, for it, and indeed the whole appearance of the pappus, may become changed after some days of exposure to wind, rain, and snow... thus Fernald (1905, p.82) gives the length of the anther as 1 mm in \\i{}E. scheuchzeri\\i0{} and 1.5-3 mm in [\\i{}E. russeolum\\i0{}], and this allows us to separate the vast majority of specimens [at CAN].\" In other Arctic regions anthers of \\i{}E. scheuchzeri\\i0{} apparently never overlap in length with those of \\i{}E. russeolum\\i0{}, but that the anthers of the quite frequent hybrids do. Polunin\u0027s difficulty in distinguishing the two species may have been due to the presence of hybrids. \\par{}Ball and Wujek (2002) in their Flora North America treatment of \\i{}Eriophorum\\i0{} did not recognize any subspecifc taxa within \\i{}E. scheuchzeri\\i0{}. However, other authors have recognized infraspecific taxa; pertinent to the present discussion is \\i{}E. scheuchzeri\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}arcticum\\i0{}, which is considered to be a circumpolar or at least partly circumpolar taxon (Novoselova 2004; Cayouette 2004). \\par{}Novoselova in Elven et al. (2003) noted that in Russia subspecies \\i{}arcticum\\i0{} differs from subspecies \\i{}scheuchzeri\\i0{} in: (i) slightly smaller size [(5-)7-20 cm vs 8-30 cm]; (ii) thinner culms [(0.7-)1.1-1.2(-2) mm versus (1-)1.2-1.5(-2) mm]; (iii) spherical, versus half-spherical, flowering spike; (iv) outermost scales lanceolate or rarely widely lanceolate, 0.6-0.9 cm long, with white margins, often yellowish near the apex (not widely lanceolate, rarely ovoid, 0.9-1 cm long, very rarely with narrow white margins); (v) outer scales lanceolate, long-pointed, black or dark grey with pale margins, usually with at least some red stripes of pigmented cells (not narrowly lanceolate, very long-pointed, brownish grey, with narrow pale margins, and with numerous red stripes). \\par{}Cayouette (2004) revised the \\i{}Eriophoum russeolum \\i0{}- \\i{}E. scheuchzeri\\i0{} complex in North America. He noted that \\i{}E. scheuchzeri\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}scheuchzeri\\i0{} differs from other rhizomatous taxa with solitary whitish spikelets, including their hybrids with the two subspecies of \\i{}E. russeolum\\i0{}, by having the shortest anthers (0.35-0.8 mm) and the narrowest (0.4-1.0 mm) and most narrowly acuminate medial fertile scales. These scales are dark gray to blackish with narrow hyaline margins or with hyaline margins absent. Cayouette (2004) recognised \\i{}E. scheuchzeri\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}arcticum\\i0{},\\i{} \\i0{}following Novoselova (1994), and provided a table listing the main differences between the subspecies. The range of subsp. arcticum was established for northeast North America, and collections from Axel Heiberg, east central Baffin, Devon, Ellesmere, Prince Charles, Southampton Islands in Nunavut and from northern-most Quebec were confirmed as belonging to this subspecies. \\par{}In the present treatment we are provisionally treating \\i{}E. scheuchzeri \\i0{}in the broad sense, including\\i{} \\i0{}subsp. \\i{}arcticum\\i0{}. Subspecies \\i{}arcticum\\i0{} appears to be the widespread and common entity in the Arctic Archipelago, while subsp. \\i{}scheuchzeri\\i0{} may be restricted to the southern-most arctic islands. However, the presence of specimens having characters intermediate between the two subspecies in the High Arctic, together with the mostly overlapping or non-discrete character states differentiating the subspecies make identification at the subspecies level difficult. A more thorough study of Canadian Arctic material, particularly from the western Arctic, is needed.\u003e","\u003cTwo races have been recognised, a widely distributed subsp. \\i{}vaginatum\\i0{} in Eurasia and northwestern North America and a more restricted subsp. \\i{}spissum\\i0{} in northeastern North America and Greenland. Porsild (1957) suggested that the western subsp. \\i{}vaginatum\\i0{} gradually passes into subsp. \\i{}spissum\\i0{} east of the 100th meridian. Elven et al. (2003) accepted this concept, which was also mapped by Porsild and Cody (1980). Hultén (1968) had a different concept where the two races were largely sympatric, both occurring in Alaska and Yukon. Specimens he annotated as subsp. \\i{}spissum\\i0{} from Alaska (in S) are inseparable from European and type \\i{}E. vaginatum\\i0{} s.s. Only one taxon is recognised by Ball and Wujek (2002) in \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{}. If two subspecies are accepted, the plants from Banks Melville and Victoria Islands belong to subsp. \\i{}vaginatum\\i0{}, those from Baffin and Southampton to subsp. \\i{}spissum\\i0{}.\\par{}A study of the effects of variable soil oxygen and nutrient availability of \\i{}E. angustifolium\\i0{} and \\i{}E. vaginatum\\i0{} was done by Gebauer et al. (1995) near Toolik Lake, Alaska. It was shown that whole-plant growth in \\i{}E. vaginatum\\i0{} improved in flooded soils, but only when nitrogen availability was high. In areas of low nitrogen availability, growth was reduced by 20% compared to growth in drier more aerobic soil. \\par{}The roots of \\i{}E. vaginatum\\i0{} have been shown to have the ability to absorb free amino acids as well as inorganic nitrogen (Chapin et al. 1993). This was the first documented example of a non-mycorrhizal plant with this capability. Such an adaptation is highly advantageous in the Arctic where inorganic nitrogen is often limiting. Factors regulating the uptake of ammonium and glycine in the field were investigated by Leadley et al. (1997). Nitrogen supply rate was found to be more important than soil factors (buffer capacity and diffusion coefficient), root density, or root uptake kinetics. \\par{}Leadly et al. (1997) presented a model of nitrogen uptake by \\i{}Eriophorum vaginatum\\i0{} roots in the field and discuss some of the ecological implications. \\par{}Moorhead et al. (1993) modelled the relative contributions of phosphatases associated with the living roots of \\i{}E. vaginatum\\i0{} and phosphatases associated with soil microbes to the phosphorus released from the substrate within the tussocks of the plant. They found that the former contributed 4% of the total phosphorus released, but that this amount was almost twice the annual demand for the plant. Thus, \\i{}E. vaginatum\\i0{} may obtain a significant amount of phosphorus from the activity of root surface phosphatase. They also found that 28% of the phosphatase activity occurred during a brief period of time in autumn when substrate availability was high. Since maximum growth occurs early in the year, \\i{}E. vaginatum\\i0{} must draw on reserves from the previous year to sustain growth.\\par{}McGraw (1993) studied ecological genetic variation in seed banks and reported on the differentiation of extant and seed-bank-derived populations of \\i{}Eriophorum vaginatum.\\i0\\par{}The role of \\i{}E. vaginatum\\i0{} in methane flux from boreal peat-lands was studied by Pullman et al. (1995).\\par{}Stoner et al. (1982) studied seasonal dynamics and standing crops of biomass and nutrients in a subarctic tundra vegetation in Alaska and found the total aboveground and belowground standing crop or organic matter and biomass was greater in an \\i{}E. vaginatum\\i0{} tussock tundra than on an adjacent north-facing slope.\u003e","\u003cIn the vegetative state, this species can be a challenge to distinguishe from \\i{}Carex nardina\\i0{}. Polunin (1940) noted that except for local variations in luxuriance, this plant appears to be much the same in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. He predicted that in time it may be found on most ice-free land, although it had not been recorded from several considerable areas. He also observed that it is \"remarkably overlooked\" and for this reason possibly under-collected. \\par{}\\i{}Kobresia myosuroides\\i0{} is reported to proliferate in \"single passage\" vehicle tracks through High Arctic tundra (Kevan et al. 1995). Near Lake Hazen, Ellesmere Island, vehicle tracks tend to be depleted of nutrients and generally low in vegetative cover . \\par{}The roots of \\i{}K. myosuroides\\i0{} have been shown to have the ability to absorb free amino acids as well as inorganic nitrogen (Raab et al. 1996). Such an adaptation is highly advantageous in the Arctic where inorganic nitrogen is often limiting.\u003e","\u003cA local and variable species, not yet fully understood. Some authors consider \\i{}K. hyperborea\\i0{} and \\i{}K. macrocarpa\\i0{} to be distinct endemic North American species, while others include these and \\i{}K. sibirica\\i0{} in the southwest Asian species \\i{}K. schoenoides\\i0{} (C.A. Meyer) Steudel. In the Asian plants, the bisexual spikelets are reported to have three staminate flowers and no sterile scales (P. Ball, personal communication, 1998).\u003e","\u003cPolunin (1940) observed that \\i{}K. simpliciuscula\\i0{} prefers less dry and exposed places than does \\i{}K. myosuroides\\i0{}, often growing in quite damp meadows among grasses. It grows most frequently to about 12 cm high but sometimes exceeds 25 cm or, in unfavourable situations, may be as short as 4 cm. It is markedly calciphilous, but probably not always so (Polunin 1940). It is often badly smutted with fungus. \\par{}\"\\i{}Kobresia simpliciuscula\\i0{} s.s. does not reach the Arctic in mainland Europe and is also absent from Iceland. All Svalbard and all studied Greenland and Canada material belong to the \\i{}\u0027holarctica\u0027\\i0{} entity, which seems to be the only one in the Arctic\" (Elven et al. 2003).\u003e","\u003cPolunin (1940, p. 104) noted that all material in the Canadian Eastern Arctic \"has the orifice of the upper sheath \"short\" and with a firm border, and the spikelets short and few-flowered, and so belongs not to the European lowland heath form (subsp. \\i{}germanicum\\i0{}) but to the wide-ranging \"arctic-alpine\" [\\i{}Scirpus caespitosus\\i0{} var. \\i{}callosus\\i0{}] \"(here \\i{}Trichophorum\\i0{} \\i{}cespitosum\\i0{}).\u003e","\u003cThe name \\i{}A. borealis\\i0{} was published in 1838, and used by many authors, including Hitchcock (1905) and Porsild (1964). However, the name \\i{}A. mertensii\\i0{} had been applied to the same taxon since 1836. In the protologue of \\i{}A. mertensii\\i0{} by Trinius in 1836, the name is given as \"\\i{}Agrostis Mertensii\\i0{} Herb. Acad. Petrop.\" and the localities of the species cited as \"In And. Chil. austr. (Eandem legit b. Mertens in Unalaschka)\". The epithet and the method of citation suggest that Trinius was basing the description primarily on Mertens\u0027s Alaskan specimen, which was designated as \"the type specimen\" by A.S. Hitchcock (1905). This is to be regarded as a lectotype [following Art. 9.8 of the \\i{}Tokyo Code\\i0{} Greuter, McNeill, et al. 1994]. \\i{}Agrostis mertensii\\i0{} was also published by Trinius in Agrostol. 2: 85 (1841), a preprint from Mém. Acad. St. Petersb. ser. 6 Sci. Nat. 4(1): 331 (1845). This was thought, by Hitchcock (1905) and some later authors, to be the first publication and to have post-dated the name \\i{}A. borealis\\i0{} Hartman. The interpretation was followed by many authors, including Porsild (1957) (personal communication, Dr. J. McNeill, Director Emeritus, Royal Ontario Museum, 1995). \\par{}Tzvelev (1976, 1983) suggested that within \\i{}A. mertensii\\i0{} there is subsp. \\i{}mertensis\\i0{} and subsp.\\i{} borealis\\i0{} (Hartman) Tzvelev, and he provided the following key to distinguish them. \\par{}Spikelets 3-4 mm long; lemma entirely scabrous due to very short spinules or pointed tubercles; tufts of hair on the callus about 0.5 mm long, 1/4 the length of the lemma...subsp. \\i{}mertensii\\i0{} \\par{}Spikelets 2-3.5 mm long; lemma slightly scabrous only in the upper part; tufts of hair on the callus about 0.3 mm long, 1/5-1/6 the length of the lemma....subsp. \\i{}borealis\\i0{} \\par{}In discussions with Dr. Tzvelev (Feb. 1999), he suggested that subsp. \\i{}mertensii\\i0{} is Beringian and subsp. \\i{}borealis\\i0{} has an Atlantic distribution in North America. This lead to the questions, (a) Can both species be recognised in North American material? and (b) If so, what is the distribution of the subspecies and what happens towards the middle of North America? \\par{}To address these questions, Aiken examined 22 specimens, ranging in distribution from Alaska to Greenland, including Alaska 4, Yukon 2, central continental North America 7, Labrador 2, Arctic islands 3, and Greenland 4. In this limited sample, spikelet lengths ranged from 2.4 to 3.4 mm long. One northeastern Alaskan sample (CAN 327780) and one Yukon sample (CAN 31693) from within the area of Beringian distribution had spikelet lengths 2.8 and 2.5 mm long, respectively. These spikelets are shorter than the 3 mm, at least, expected for subsp. \\i{}mertensii\\i0{}. No spikelets 3.5-4 mm long were found in the sample. \\par{}To evaluate the lemma scabrosity character, each lemma was examined at 40×, with the lemma oriented towards the light source. This allowed the tiny scabrous trichomes to be seen. Five samples had glabrous lemmas, and 17 were seen as \"entirely scabrous due to very short spinules or tubercules\". This character was judged to be inconspicuous, difficult to apply, and probably not reliable. \\par{}Lemma and callus lengths for the 22 samples were measured. The callus lengths were measured at 40× and calculated in millimetres. Lemma lengths ranged from 1.7 to 2.8 mm; callus lengths from 0.25 to 0.5 mm. Six specimens had lemmas 2.1-2.8 long, with a callus 0.4 mm long; 8 specimens had lemmas 1.8-2.5 mm long, with a callus 0.3 mm long, and 6 specimens had lemmas 1.8-2.5 mm long, with a callus 0.3 mm long. One lemma 2.5 mm long had a callus 0.25 mm, and another lemma 2 mm long had a callus 0.35 mm. These initial observations suggested a continuum in the length ranges. While the sample size is small, no way to reliably recognise more than one taxon in \\i{}A. mertensii\\i0{} samples from North America was found using the characters suggested by Tzvelev (1983). In May 2002, Tzvelev agreed to drop the recognition of these subspecies in the Panarctic Flora Checklist (Elven et al. 2003).\\par{}\u003e","\u003cThe name \\i{}A. magellanicus\\i0{} follows Soreng et al. (2003). Before that \\i{}Alopecurus borealis\\i0{} Trin. was accepted as the valid name, this name replacing \\i{}A. alpinus\\i0{} Sm. which is predated by \\i{}A. alpinus\\i0{} D. Villars. (Stace 1997). \\par{}The species is a high polyploid, with very variable numbers reported (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 70 - about 150) and morphologically variable, with several entities described as species or subspecies. The name \\i{}A. borealis\\i0{} may relate to a Beringian entity (slightly) different from the main plant in the Arctic (Elven, personal communication, 2005).\\par{}Porsild (1964), probably writing from his experiences in Greenland, suggested that this species is strongly nitrophilous, and with fertiliser and minimum cultivation, provides good grazing, yielding short but nourishing hay. \\par{}Bell and Bliss (1978) estimated that the roots of \\i{}A. borealis\\i0{} live 3.4-7 years.\u003e","\u003cPorsild (1964) ignored var. \\i{}longiglumis\\i0{} Polunin, which was described from a thermal oasis on Baffin Island. Polunin (1940) described the species as \"an atrocious \\i{}typus polymorphus\\i0{}\". Aiken and Lefkovitch (1990) studied the genus, documented considerable phenotypic plasticity within the species, and found only subsp. \\i{}latifolia\\i0{} on the Arctic Archipelago, although subsp. \\i{}arundinacea\\i0{} (Trin.) Tzvelev occurs nearby on the North American continent. No reason for recognising var. \\i{}longiglumis\\i0{} was found. \\par{}Ovenden (1986) found that \\i{}Arctagrostis latifolia\\i0{} and \\i{}Puccinellia borealis\\i0{} were common on the lake bed of Illisarvik, the site of a thermokarst lake that was artificially drained in August 1978. \\par{}The nematode \\i{}Anguina agrostis\\i0{} Steinbuck infects spikelets and causes the ovaries to enlarge and become dark purple (Mulvey 1963). Other parts of the infected spikelet become atypical. Specimens with this infection are conspicuous and have been annotated as \\i{}forma prolifera\\i0{} or \\i{}forma vivipara\\i0{}, but these names have no taxonomic validity.\u003e","\u003cTzvelev (1976) reported that \\i{}A. fulva\\i0{} is one of the best fodder plants and recommended it for introduction into cultivation in the northernmost regions of the USSR, \"as it maintains a high nutritive value even at the fruiting stage and can be used as a pasture plant for deer even during the winter. The species is also good fodder for water birds.\" \\par{}Tzvelev (1976) noted that in the USSR the High Arctic populations of this species, with smaller general dimensions (10-30 cm tall), narrower laminas, and fewer spikelets, are separated as subspecies \\i{}similis\\i0{} (Rupr.) Tzvelev but are rather only a variety, var. \\i{}similis\\i0{} (Rupr.) Tzvelev, to which not only the type of \\i{}Poa similis\\i0{} but also the type of \\i{}Poa remotiflora\\i0{} belong. No attempt to distinguish taxa within plants of the genus occurring in North America has been made, although considerable phenotypic plasticity, apparently often related to microclimate, has been observed. \\par{}Tzvelev (1976) noted that \"the affinity of the genera \\i{}Arctophila\\i0{} and \\i{}Dupontia\\i0{} is confirmed by the existence of the sterile hybrid × \\i{}Arctodupontia scleroclada\\i0{} (Rupr.) Tzvelev, 1973, Novosti Sist. Vyssh. Rast. 10: 91 (\u003d \\i{}Poa scleroclada\\i0{} Rupr...) described from the Malaya Zemlya tundra...but recently also found on the Chukotsk Peninsula\". On the basis of spikelet structure, it occupies an intermediate position between the parental genera. The intergeneric hybrid has not been reported from North America, but there are places where the two genera occur together and where the possibility of hybrid plants should be investigated, for example, on the Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula and Richards Island at the mouth of the Mackenzie River. However, in Feb. 1999, in a survey of candidate specimens at LE, the only record of the hybrid was the type collection (LE) and it is a questionable specimen. All other specimens of \\i{}Arctodupontia\\i0{} from the Chukotsk Peninsula were re-determined as \\i{}Arctophila fulva\\i0{} (R. Elven, personal communication, 1999). However, hybrid populations between \\i{}Arctophila\\i0{} and \\i{}Dupontia\\i0{} have recently been confirmed (also by molecular means) from Svalbard, Brysting and Elven (2005).\\par{}Ovenden (1986) found \\i{}Arctophila fulva\\i0{} was an early colonising species on the lake bed of Illisarvik, the site of a thermokarst lake that was artificially drained in August 1978. \\par{}Elven et al. (2003) indicated that the impressive infraspecific variation is probably too insufficiently known to allow for the recognition of any subspecific taxa. \\par{}Aiken and Buck (2002) described aquatic leaves and vegetative proliferation in this taxon (additional images in the image library). They observed re-growth from apparently dead, previous season\u0027s straw that had overwintered in the Arctic. Observations on transplanted material and field observations documented that new shoots grew from the apex, and nodes of the previous season\u0027s stems. Strong underground rhizomes, and roots developed, resulting in propagules able to develop into new plants. The previous season\u0027s straw that regenerates is probably detached by animals mid-season, before food reserved in the stems are withdrawn to the rhizomes and roots. Such regeneration of detached straw that has overwintered had not been reported previous for any other grass species.\u003e","\u003cThis taxon is characterised by having a long stem with 4-5 exposed nodes, leaves that are often flat and very scabrous on the abaxial surface. A single specimen was collected on Baffin Island beside the Soper River in 2002. The species occurs in southern Greenland and is not unexpected on Baffin Island\\par{}Greene (1980) considered that this taxon, which he recognised as a variety, differs from var. \\i{}canadensis\\i0{} in having firm glumes that are 4-6 mm long, rarely hyaline, strongly scabrous on the back, often short-ciliate on the keel. \\par{}The name is based on \\i{}Arundo langsdorfii\\i0{} Link 1821. When he transferred the name to Calamagrostis in 1824, Trinius corrected Link\u0027s orthographic error; Link named the species after a Langsdorff, not Langsdorf: thus the name is \\i{}Calamagrostis langsdorffii\\i0{} (Link) Trin. (Greene, personal communication, 1999). Hultén, who had broad experience on both sides of the Bering Straits, treated \\i{}langsdorffii\\i0{} as \\i{}C. canadensis\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}langsdorffii\\i0{} (Link) Hultén (1942).\\par{}Greene indicated that in \\i{}Calamagrostis\\i0{} he used subspecies only when there seemed to be clear cytological and/or morphological distinctions between entities, such as the primarily 2\\i{}n \\i0{}\u003d 28 sexual \\i{}C. stricta\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}stricta\\i0{} and the 2\\i{}n \\i0{}\u003d 42-114+ polyploid apomictic complex he named \\i{}C. stricta\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}inexpansa\\i0{}. In the case of \\i{}C. canadensis\\i0{} Greene chose to recognise varieties because the taxa (such as var. \\i{}langsdorffii\\i0{}) seems to intergrade with var. \\i{}canadensis\\i0{} in morphology, chromosome number, and reproductive mode. He noted that with more experimental work, these entities may show enough distinctions to be treated as distinct subspecies as opposed to varieties (personal communication, Greene, 1999). \\par{}It was the opinion of Greene (when writing the \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{} treatment of this genus, Marr et al. 2007) that if one accepts that \\i{}C. purpurea\\i0{} and \\i{}C. canadensis\\i0{} are synonymous, then \\i{}C. canadensis\\i0{} (Michx.) Beauv. 1812 (based on \\i{}Arundo canadensis\\i0{} Michx. 1803) has priority over \\i{}C. purpurea \\i0{}(Trin.) Trin. 1824 (based on \\i{}Arundo purpurea\\i0{} Trin. 1821). Greene considered \\i{}C. canadensis\\i0{} in North America and \\i{}C. purpurea\\i0{} in northern Eurasia to be manifestations of the same circumpolar species/agamic complex, but that tradition has kept the names separate in regional floras. \\par{}Elven et al. (2003) agreed that \\i{}C. purpurea\\i0{} is probably a basal sexual species of the aggregate. \\i{}Calamagrostis canescens\\i0{} (Weber) Roth 1789 (based on \\i{}Arundo canescens\\i0{} Weber 1780) is another sexual tetraploid. If the entire aggregate is merged, then it also has to include \\i{}C. canescens\\i0{}, and then this name would have priority before \\i{}C. canadensis\\i0{}. It is therefore best to keep the high-polyploid agamosperms separate, in which case the name \\i{}C. canadensis\\i0{} can be used for the Canadian plants. It is also justified to keep basal sexuals and derived and assumed allopolyploid agamics as separate species.\\par{}Elven et al. (2003) noted that Löve and Löve (1975) separated \u0027species\u0027 in this aggregate purely on basis of ploidy levels. They considered \\i{}C. canescens\\i0{} and \\i{}C. angustifolia\\i0{} (subsp. \\i{}tenuis\\i0{}) as tetraploids, \\i{}C. canadensis\\i0{} as hexaploid, and \\i{}C. phragmitoides\\i0{} and \\i{}C. langsdorffii\\i0{} as octoploids. They did not include in their Atlas the multitude of deviating numbers reported for these taxa, and they sorted numbers among taxa without much consideration of the names given by the original reporters (Tateoka 1973, Mitchell 1968, and Greene 1984). \\par{}Elven et al. (2003) discussed the \\i{}Calamagrostis canadensis\\i0{} aggregate (\\i{}C. canadensis\\i0{} s.l., \\i{}C. phragmitoides\\i0{}, \\i{}C. tenuis\\i0{}) and noted that this aggregate expresses many of the same traits as the \\i{}C. purpurascens\\i0{} aggregate and \\i{}C. neglecta\\i0{} s.l., i.e., the presence of morphologically more or less distinguishable sexual tetraploids and less well-defined apomictic high-ploids. There are strong indications that the apomicts are alloploids.\\par{}\u003e","\u003cPorsild (1957) mapped a single record from Nunavut, Baffin Island, Iqaluit. It is presumably based on the specimens \\i{}J.A. Calder, 2155\\i0{}, 25 July 1948, gravel along Sylvia Grinnell River. Only 1 small colony. DAO 19019 and DAO 106575. Sheet DAO 19019 was annotated as \\i{}C. lapponica\\i0{} (Wahlenb.) Hartm. in 1951, by P. Ls-M l\u0027Institute Agricole d\u0027Oka, with the note, the culm and leaves a little stiff, but the awn and callus-hairs are quite typical; trichomes not well developed. In early July, 2004, Aiken found previous season\u0027s \\i{}Calamagrostis\\i0{} straw in a small patch near the Sylvia Grinnell River opposite the end of the runway. It is known from their diaries that Senn and Calder, who botanised around Iqaluit in 1948, used to travel to the end of the runway with the water truck that drove down regularly to obtain water for the Military base at Crystal 2. \\par{}Elven examined the \\i{}Calder 2155\\i0{} specimen in May, 2005, and annotated it as \\i{}C. lapponicum\\i0{} because the specimen has relatively short leaves, few nodes culm nodes exposed, leaves that tend to be inrolled and glabrous or almost glabrouse on the abaxial surface. Elven noted that the species is a polyplid and never found with functional anthers. The sterial anther \"ghosts\" may remain in the inflorescences long after flowering.\u003e","\u003cThe name of the species is disputed, as \\i{}Calamagrostis neglecta\\i0{} or \\i{}C. stricta\\i0{}. These two names refer to the same species or subspecies. The priority name \\i{}C. neglecta\\i0{} was rejected because it had been assumed to apply a to previously described \\i{}A. halleri\\i0{} Willd., and therefore \\i{}A. neglecta\\i0{} becomes a nomen illegitimum. However, this was argued by Tzvelev (1973) , who reinstated \\i{}C. neglecta\\i0{}. Soreng et al. (2003) treated \\i{}C. neglecta\\i0{} as a nom. illeg. superfl. but do not appear to have considered Tzvelev\u0027s arguements. As long as it has not finally been refuted, we use here the priority name, \\i{}C. neglecta\\i0{}.\\par{}The \\i{}\u0027neglecta groenlandica\u0027\\i0{} entity is mainly or entirely tetraploid and sexual. It is also heterogeneous, and both Russians (Tzvelev) and North Americans (Soreng et al. 2003) accept two races, a mainly boreal subsp. \\i{}neglecta\\i0{} (subsp. \\i{}stricta\\i0{}) that does not reach the islands, and a subsp. \\i{}groenlandica\\i0{} that does. \\par{}Elven (personal communication, 2005) drew attention to a specimen he collected that belongs to \\i{}C. neglecta\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}groenlandica\\i0{}: Melville Island SE: Valley W of Beverley Inlet, inland from Skene Bay, S of and near lake. 75° 03.595\u0027N 107° 50.017\u0027W. 13.08.1999. Leg. R. Elven (O). This supplements the earlier record from Mould Bay, Prince Patrick Island, indicating this taxon is present in the western arctic islands and not merely an accidental introduction by planes landing at Mould Bay.\\par{}Greene annotated three specimens from the Canadian Arctic Archipelago as \\i{}C. stricta\\i0{} var.\\i{} borealis\\i0{} var. (Laest.) Hartm. in 1997, presumably planning to recognise this taxon in the \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{} treatment. Data from specimens that Greene annotated have been used to gather the data used to describe this taxon.\\par{}Another entity that is part of the \\i{}C. neglecta\\i0{} aggregate (Elven et al. 2003) is the \\i{}\u0027inexpansa\u0027\\i0{} entity, which is probably entirely high-polyploid and agamospermic. Greene suggested it as a case of autopolyploidy, and therefore considered it a subspecies of \\i{}C. neglecta\\i0{} (\\i{}C. stricta\\i0{} in his treatment). It is found in continental arctic regions of North America (Greene 1980) but has not yet been confirmed in the Flora region.\\par{}\\par{}\u003e","\u003cElven et al. (2003) noted that Tzvelev considered that the \\i{}C. purpurascens\\i0{} aggregate \"includes species \\i{}C. arctica\\i0{}, \\i{}C. maltei\\i0{}, \\i{}C. poluninii\\i0{}, \\i{}C. purpurascens\\i0{}, and \\i{}C. sesquiflora\\i0{}. The aggregate contains sexual tetraploids both in Asia and North America, in \\i{}C. purpurascens\\i0{} s.s. and in \\i{}C. sesquiflora\\i0{}, and probably apomictic hexaploids, octoploids, and possibly decaploids.\" The plants with higher chromosome numbers are probably agamospermic but whether these are auto-polyploids, allo-polyploids, or the product of a combination of these is unknown. \\par{}If the entities could be documented as morphologically and geographically definable parts of an agamic complex, recognition at some taxonomic level would be relevant. Soreng et al. (2003) follow this up by recognition of the tetraploid Beringian \\i{}C. sesquiflora\\i0{} (also including \\i{}C. arctica\\i0{}).\\par{}Greene (1980) analysed the variation in both morphology and cytology of North American taxa. He found reasons to divide\\i{} C. purpurescens \\i0{}into two varieties only, var. \\i{}purpurascens\\i0{} (including \\i{}C. maltei\\i0{} and \\i{}C. yukonensis\\i0{} Nash) and var. \\i{}laricina\\i0{} (including \\i{}C. poluninii\\i0{}). Greene did not, however, consider the Beringian (American) plants.\\par{}The two taxa are distinguished by a few characters, but they are largely allopatric. Both reach the Arctic area; var. \\i{}purpurascens\\i0{} in Alaska, north mainland NWT, the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, and central and northern Greenland, and var. \\i{}laricina\\i0{} in north mainland NWT, the Ungava area, and southwestern Greenland (as \\i{}C. poluninii\\i0{}).\u003e","\u003cLöve and Löve (1975) \u0027adjusted\u0027 the counts so as to fit a uniformly tetraploid (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 52) concept of \\i{}D. alpina\\i0{}, while they indicated that plants counted under this name, but with 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 26 and 39, could be hybrids. As seen from the above, the 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 52 counts are in the minority. In northern Norway and Svalbard, plants that fit the diagnostic characters of \\i{}D. alpina\\i0{} are counted with 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d about 39, 41, 49, and 50, and in several of these areas there is no possibility of (recent) hybridisation, as this is the only \\i{}Deschampsia\\i0{} present. The uniformly tetraploid chromosome number of the Löves that should characterise this species is therefore unknown from what is the type area of \\i{}D. alpina\\i0{} (northern Fennoscandia, \"Lapponia\"). This does not exclude that the entire \u0027species\u0027 is an old hybrid complex, probably involving \\i{}D. cespitosa\\i0{}, that has turned to vivipary. The few diploid counts of 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 26 may originate from occasionally vegetatively proliferating \\i{}D. cespitosa\\i0{} s.s. and not from \\i{}D. alpina\\i0{}. \\par{}This amphi-Atlantic bulbil-reproducing entity differs from \\i{}D. cespitosa\\i0{} (\\i{}D. cespitosa\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}cespitosa\\i0{}) in other characters besides the production of bulbils and is morphologically separable from the occasional vegetatively proliferating forms of subsp. \\i{}cespitosa\\i0{}. If the taxon is shown to be an autopolyploid derivative of subsp. \\i{}cespitosa\\i0{} it might be better treated as a subspecies of \\i{}D. cespitosa\\i0{}, as done by Tzvelev (1976) and Clarke (1980). However, if the taxon is shown to be an alloploid, \\i{}D. brevifolia\\i0{} might be the other parent (Elven et al. 2003).\u003e","\u003cThis taxon was considered part of a \\i{}D. cespitosa\\i0{} \\ldblquote{}complex\\rdblquote{} by Kawano (1963, 1966) who investigated the cytogeography and evolution of members of the complex from many parts of the world, including the Canadian Arctic. He reported on the hypothetical relationships of members of the \\i{}D. cespitosa\\i0{} complex, with chromosome numbers ranging from 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 26, 28, 35, 38, 39, 41, 49, 52, to 56 and noted that Tateoka (1955) and Bowden (1960b) had reported the existence of \\ldblquote{}B\\rdblquote{} or supernumerary chromosomes in \\i{}D. cespitosa\\i0{}. \\par{}Porsild (1964) recognised \\i{}D. cespitosa\\i0{} (now considered an excluded taxon) and three other taxa within the genus \\i{}Deschampsia\\i0{}, i.e., \\i{}D. alpina\\i0{}, \\i{}D. brevifolia\\i0{}, and \\i{}D. pumila\\i0{} (see \\i{}D. sukatschewii \\i0{}(Popl.) Roshev. subsp. \\i{}borealis\\i0{} (Trautv.) Tzvelev). \\par{}Aiken et al.

Further field work has established that there is a single, phenotypically plastic taxon in the Canadian Arctic, similar to the type recognised by Robert Brown from Melville Island as \\i{}D. brevifolia\\i0{}. The taxa \\i{}D. cespitosa\\i0{} s.s. and \\i{}D. glauca\\i0{}, as understood in northern Europe, probably do not occur in the Canadian Arctic unless they have been introduced (Elven, personal communication, 2005). \\par{}The phenotypic plasticity in this taxon was observed in plants transplanted from Eureka Sound, Ellesmere Island (80°09\u0027N, 86°00\u0027W), in 1990, to Iqaluit, Baffin Island (64°44\u0027N, 68°28\u0027W), and Ottawa, Ontario (45°18\u0027N, 75°50\u0027W). Over a 3-year period the plants grown in Iqaluit became smaller and more stunted. Many of the 10 plants grown in Ottawa died, but the one illustrated in the image library became larger and with more diffuse inflorescences as photographed in 1994. In the photograph, the previous season\\rquote{}s inflorescence as seen in the straw has tightly appressed branches, the 1994 inflorescences have spreading branches. The voucher for the original collection is of a plant approximately 16 cm high, whereas the voucher for the photograph in the image library is a plant 32-33 cm high and documents the phenotypic plasticity expressed. \\par{}The very short awn is sometimes absent or broken and often overlooked, resulting in small specimens being misidentified as \\i{}Poa\\i0{} species.\\par{}\u003e","\u003cThis taxon was known in Canada as \\i{}D. pumila\\i0{} (Griseb.) Ostenf. (Porsild 1957, Bowden 1960b, Hultén 1968). Tzvelev (1976) recognised that \\i{}D. pumila\\i0{} is a later homonym of \\i{}D. pumila\\i0{} Steven. ex Fomin and Waronow, referable to \\i{}Catabrosa\\i0{}. He recognised the taxon at the subspecific level of \\i{}D. cespitosa\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}paramushirensis\\i0{}, distinguishing it from \\i{}D. cespitosa\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}borealis\\i0{} Hultén (1968), and he placed the name \\i{}D. borealis\\i0{} (Trautv.) Roshev. into synonymy under \\i{}D. pumila\\i0{}. A comparison of characters from Canadian and Eurasian specimens, considered to be this taxon, is given in McLachlan et al. (1989), Table 2. \\par{}The combination \\i{}D. sukatschewii\\i0{} (Popl.) Roshev subsp. \\i{}borealis\\i0{} (Trautv.) Tzvelev was published by Tzvelev (2000). The Panarctic Flora project Elven et al. (2003) suggests that North American plants assigned to this species may belong to two subspecies, a seashore or coastal plant that is different from a more northern arctic \u0027moss cushion\u0027. It is possible that in Canada there is an eastern Arctic taxon, subspecies \\i{}borealis\\i0{}, and a western Arctic taxon \\i{}D. sukatschewii\\i0{} (Popl.) Roshev. subsp. \\i{}orientalis \\i0{}(Hultén) Tzvelev.\\par{}Elven examined specimens from the Canadian Arctic Archipelgo (May 2005) and concluded that those from the eastern and western islands are all subsp. \\i{}borealis.\\i0{}\u003e","\u003cThe genus \\i{}Dupontia\\i0{} R. Br. was named \"in honour of Monsieur Dupont, of Paris, author of a valuable essay on the sheaths of the leaves of grasses, and observations on the genus \\i{}Atriplex\\i0{}\". The species name \\i{}fisheri \\i0{}\"was that of Mr. Fisher, whose herbarium contained the most complete series of specimens of this grass\" (Brown 1823). The type was collected on Melville Island, Canadian Arctic Archipelago. In 1841, \\i{}Dupontia fisheri\\i0{} var. \\i{}flavescens\\i0{} Hooker and Arnott was recognised. It had yellow anthers and was based on a specimen from Kotzebue Sound, Alaska (Hooker and Arnott 1841).

Trautv.\\b{} \\b0{}When Ruprecht (1846) described \\i{}D. pelligera\\i0{} he commented that \"whether this is \\i{}D. fisheri\\i0{} R.Br. without comparative original specimens I scarcely dare to decide\". He had not seen the Robert Brown type that was collected from the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. \\par{}Holm (1907) recognised \\i{}D. micrantha \\i0{}Holm, claiming that it was readily distinguished from \\i{}D. fisheri\\i0{} and \\i{}D.\\i0{} \\i{}psilosantha \\i0{}by the small size of the spikelets and very narrow leaves. He based his description on material from Halton, Labrador (collected by Waghorne, CAN 36774), and Cape Henrietta, Hudson Bay, northern Quebec (Cape Henrietta, collected by Spreadborough, CAN 513741). \\par{}Polunin (1940) commented that many authors had pointed out the impossibility of keeping \\i{}D. psilosantha\\i0{} as a distinct species and reduced the taxon to a forma. He admitted that the type material of \\i{}D. fisheri\\i0{} has the glumes more or less obtuse and the lemmas hairy at the base, and that plants assigned to \\i{}psilosantha\\i0{} are strikingly different \u0027at least in their extreme development\u0027. Polunin (1940) also noted that in 1936, during numerous field observations in the Eastern Arctic, he had found such a great range of variation, even in closely contiguous plants in the same stand, that he concluded \u0027Holm\u0027s plant is a mere \\i{}forma depauperata\\i0{}\u0027\\i{} \\i0{}and generally the result of \u0027a competition effect\u0027. He reduced the taxon to \\i{}D. fisheri \\i0{}f.\\i{} micrantha \\i0{}(Holm) Polunin. He observed what he considered to be a striking aristate form geographically delimited in the Eastern Arctic. It had been named provisionally, on herbarium material, by Malte before he died, and was formally recognised by Polunin (1940) as \\i{}D. fisheri\\i0{} var. \\i{}aristata\\i0{} Malte ex Polunin. \\par{}Porsild (1964) recognised this taxon and also \\i{}D. fisheri\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}psilosantha\\i0{} (Rupr.) Hultén, which we have placed in synonymy with \\i{}D. fisheri\\i0{}. While extreme morphological expressions occur, there appears to be a continuum of variation among Canadian specimens. \\par{}The characters used to separate subspecies in northern Europe and Russia, e.g., shape of glumes, number of florets per spikelet, lemma hairiness, and anther length, do not align consistently among North American samples (Brysting et al. 2003). \\par{}Brysting et al. (2003) studied the genus \\i{}Dupontia\\i0{} from herbarium specimens, including types and chromosome vouchers, by numerical taxonomy, mapping the distribution of morphological characteristics, consideration of chromosome numbers, and field work in the Canadian Arctic. They concluded that morphological characters, used in the literature to divide the genus \\i{}Dupontia \\i0{}into more than one taxon, cannot be reliably applied to distinguish most North American plants. In North America, we might see two endpoints, which correspond, more or less, to \\i{}D. psilosantha \\i0{}and \\i{}D. fisheri\\i0{}, respectively, as these two are recognised in the floras of, for instance, Greenland and Svalbard. However, as suggested by Polunin (1940), there appears to be a continuum of variation among North American specimens and too many intermediate forms that exist, which are impossible to place in two or three categories. Even though only a limited sample of Eurasian specimens were included in the analyses, there is no reason to believe that the inclusion of more specimens from this part of the Arctic will change this conclusion. On the contrary, the continuity in measurements will probably be even more evident. Until further evidence is available, Brysting et al. (2003, 2004) suggest that the genus is treated as monotypic. \\par{}Molecular evidence supports the use of a wide species concept (Brysting et al. 2004). DNA sequence data (trnL-trnF, ITS; including plants from Russia, Svalbard, Canada, and Alaska) revealed almost no variation within \\i{}Dupontia\\i0{}. Only a couple of base pair changes, which were related neither to ploidy levels nor to geography, were found. DNA fingerprinting analysis (AFLP, Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism) sorted the \\i{}Dupontia\\i0{} material first of all according to geography (Russia, North America, and Svalbard). Within each geographical region, there was a tendency for plants that were sorted according to ploidy level, suggesting that the ploidy levels have most likely arisen several times within the arctic area. \\par{}Two main ploidy levels have been reported in the literature and associated with different taxa: 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 42, 44 (4\\i{}x\\i0{}) and 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 84, 88 (8\\i{}x\\i0{}). The variation in chromosome numbers within each ploidy level is probably the result of B-chromosomes, which are obviously present in these plants (Flovik 1938). \\par{}Two counts of 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 132 have previously been reported from Arctic Canada, Southampton Island, and Devon Island (Bowden 1960b, Löve and Löve, in Löve 1975a). Results from recent chromosome counts and flow cytometry (Brysting et al. 2004) have revealed that this high ploidy level (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 126-132) is widely distributed in Arctic Canada and Alaska and mainly associated with tall, coarse plants with more or less spreading branches. Löve and Ritchie (1966) assigned the three ploidy levels to three different species: \\i{}D. psilosantha\\i0{} was considered a tetraploid with 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 44, \\i{}D. pelligera\\i0{} an octoploid with 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 88, and \\i{}D. fisheri\\i0{} a decaploid with 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d132. However, Lipkin (1983) identified \\i{}D. fisheri\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}fisheri\\i0{} with the octoploid cytotype (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 88), the type material of which is from Melville Island, Canadian Arctic Archipelago. This is in agreement with recent chromosome counts of 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 88 for plants from Prince Patrick Island, which are morphologically inseparable from the type material (Brysting et al. 2004). \\par{}Tzvelev (1976) reported that \"The affinity of the genera \\i{}Arctophila\\i0{} and \\i{}Dupontia\\i0{}, is confirmed by the existence of the sterile hybrid ?\\i{}Arctodupontia scleroclada\\i0{} (Rupr.)

Within this taxon several species and subspecies have been distinguished on the basis of the following characters: leaf width, blade surfaces glabrous or pubescent, inflorescence length, glume length and width, and the presence or absence of glume and lemma hairs, the bloom on leaves, the presence or absence of small sharp papillae on culms, the width of the hyaline margins on the glumes and lemma and where trichomes occur on these structures. It is here treated as an aggregate, and the description includes the extremes of variation found in Arctic Island material. More synonymy for this complex, including specimens from outside our area, is suggested by Löve (1984), and many other names have been applied to morphological extremes of the complex by Russian authors as indicated by Tzvelev (1976). \\i{}Elymus alaskanus\\i0{} is the name used by A. Melderis (1980) in \\i{}Flora Europaea\\i0{}, Kartesz (1994), and Barkworth et al. (2007).\u003e","\u003cWhile McNeill and Dore (1976) suggested that \\i{}F. baffinensis\\i0{} may be a subspecies of \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{}, species status was supported in isozyme studies (Aiken et al. 1993, 1995b, 1997) and by studies of material from Svalbard (Fjellheim et al. 2001, Guldahl et al. 2001). \\par{}The plants from east Chukotka (LE) deviate towards \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} in general habit but confirm with \\i{}F. baffinensis\\i0{} in formal characters (e.g., hairs on the ovary). This seems to be the only place within its range where there might be a problem identifying this species (Elven et al. 2003). It has often been considered a part of the \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} aggregate but may not be very closely related to it (Aiken and Elven, in Elven et al. 2005).\\par{}Fjellheim et al.

(1993) used variation in isozyme patterns to assess species boundaries in North American arctic and alpine representatives of the \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} - (\\i{}F. ovina\\i0{}) complex. They found that isozyme profiles, in combination with chromosome numbers, delimited four discrete entities with the complex: \\i{}F. brevissima\\i0{} Jurtzev (diploid); F. aggr.\\i{} auriculata\\i0{} Drobov (diploid, neither occur on the Arctic islands); \\i{}F. baffinensis\\i0{} Polunin (tetraploid); and \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} (hexaploid). Some alleles observed in the polyploid taxa were not detected among the diploids, and some observed in \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{}, the hexaploid taxon, were not detected among the diploids. They suggested that one possible explanation for these occurrences is that the North America polyploids originated in Eurasia where there are many other potential diploid and tetraploid progenitors. \\par{}Guldahl et al. (2001) studied the \\i{}Festuca brachyphylla\\i0{} complex in Svalbard, considering chromosome counts, enzymatic, and ecological variation. In a revision of herbarium material she found that \\i{}F. edlundiae \\i0{}was the most widely distributed species, followed by \\i{}F. baffinensis. Festuca brachyphylla \\i0{}seemed to be restricted to the favourable fjord areas on central Spitsbergen, whereas \\i{}F. hyperborea\\i0{} was rare. Chromosome counts were made on several populations of each of the Svalbard species. Three were tetraploid, \\i{}F. baffinensis, F. edlundiae,\\i0{} and \\i{}F. hyperborea\\i0{}, and one was hexaploid, \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{}. \\i{}Festuca ovina\\i0{} from northern Norway was electrophoretically close to the \\i{}F. brachyphylla \\i0{}complex in Svalbard. \\i{}Festuca brachyphylla\\i0{}, \\i{}F. edlundiae\\i0{}, and \\i{}F. hyperborea\\i0{} all had an electrophoretically stronger affinity to \\i{}F. ovina\\i0{} than to \\i{}F. baffinensis,\\i0{} strengthening the impression that the complex may be an artificial taxonomic group. The close affinities between \\i{}F. ovina\\i0{}, and at least three of the species of the \\i{}F. brachyphlla\\i0{} complex suggested that they have at least one genome in common. Possible parental species may be found in the Beringina area, where the \\i{}F. brachyphylla \\i0{}and\\i{} F. ovina\\i0{} complexes probably have a long history of contact, and where diploids (i.e., \\i{}F. brevissima\\i0{} and \\i{}F. lenensis\\i0{}) from both complexes are reported. \\par{}Fjellheim et al. (2001) evaluated morphological and RAPD DNA variation in members of the \\i{}Festuca brachyphylla\\i0{} complex occurring on Svalbard. The overall level of genetical variation within the complex was low. In each of \\i{}F. baffinensis\\i0{} and \\i{}F. hyperborea\\i0{} a single phenotype was observed in all except one, and in \\i{}F. edlundiae,\\i0{} 12 RAPD phenotypes were observed. These three taxa appeared to be related.\\i{} Festuca baffinensis\\i0{} was the most distinct taxon. \\par{}The tetraploid chromosome counts from Russia (Sokolovskaya and Probatova, in Tzvelev 1976) refer to \\i{}F. edlundiae\\i0{} (vouchers in LE investigated). Only hexaploid counts are known from verified vouchers of this species (Aiken and Elven, working in LE, 1998, unpublished).\u003e","\u003cFirst discovered by B. May in isozyme studies reported by Aiken et al. (1994, 1995b). The\\i{} Festuca\\i0{} plants had been collected on Bathurst Island and were a mixture of this taxon and \\i{}F. hyperborea\\i0{}. The two species differ in having distinct isozyme profiles for at least five isozymes, and in the size and shape of the flag leaves, the size of spikelets, and the shape of the upper glumes. Plants with the isozyme profiles of \\i{}F. edlundiae\\i0{} were collected from eight sites on five of the Queen Elizabeth Islands in 1992, and from Ellesmere Island in 1993. All sites are highly calcareous with fine-grained mineral soils. A herbarium study found specimens from 30 other locations including sites in northern Greenland and the former U.S.S.R. Morphological and isozyme characteristics were used to distinguish \\i{}F. edlundiae\\i0{} from \\i{}F. baffinensis, F. brachyphylla\\i0{}, and \\i{}F. hyperborea\\i0{}. The specific epithet honours Dr. S.A. Edlund for her extensive and intensive contributions to Arctic field work and her studies of the vegetation in the Arctic Archipelago over many years (Aiken et al. 1995b). \\par{}Fjellheim et al. (2001) evaluated morphological and RAPD DNA variation in members of the \\i{}Festuca brachyphylla \\i0{}complex occurring on Svalbard and observed 12 RAPD phenotypes in \\i{}F. edlundiae. \\par{}\\i0{}Guldahl et al. (2001) studied the \\i{}Festuca brachyphylla\\i0{} complex in Svalbard, considering chromosome counts, enzymatic, and ecological variation. In a revision of herbarium material she found that \\i{}F. edlundiae \\i0{}was the most widely distributed species.\u003e","\u003cThis species was mentioned in Porsild (1964) but not mapped, although he believed it to occur on the northern islands of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. \\i{}Festuca hyperborea\\i0{} was distinguished by Holmen (1952), but the name was not validly published until a study by Frederiksen (1977). Discussed in Aiken et al. (1994, 1995b). \\par{}Elven et al. (2003) noted that only tetraploids (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 28) are known from verified \\i{}F. hyperborea\\i0{}. The Russian counts of Sokolovskaya and Probatova, in Tzvelev (1976), were made on material identified from the insufficient first description of Holmen (1952). The investigated chromosome vouchers in LE represent \\i{}F. edlundiae\\i0{} (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 28) and small-grown \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 42) (Aiken and Elven, unpublished, 1999). Most of the counts referred to this species by Löve and Löve (1975) must be critically checked against vouchers, as some of them may refer to the later described \\i{}F. edlundiae\\i0{}. \\par{}A revision of large parts of the materials in LE proved \\i{}F. hyperborea\\i0{} to be very rare in Russia. Alexeev had applied Holmen\u0027s very insufficient criteria and determined nearly all small-grown \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} as \\i{}F. hyperborea\\i0{}. We (Aiken and Elven 1998) found evidence for \\i{}F. hyperborea\\i0{} in the restricted sense of Frederiksen (1977), Aiken et al. (1995b), Guldahl (1999), Fjellheim et al. (2001), and Guldahl et al. (2001), only from a very few areas: northernmost Taimyr, Severnaya Zemlya, and perhaps Novosiberian Islands. All plants named as such from Chukotka and Wrangel Island were reidentified. The regions in Russian Far East are therefore omitted from the distributional parts of the Panarctic Flora Checklist (Elven et al. 2003). \\par{}The same may be the case in North America. During a 1999 expedition, \\i{}F. hyperborea\\i0{} was only found in the northernmost, coldest parts of the Canadian Arctic. The tetraploid counts of Aiken et al. (1995b) also came from these areas. It is very easy to mistake small-grown \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} for \\i{}F. hyperborea\\i0{}. Elven claimed to have seen no specimens from Alaska of this species (Elven, personal communication, 2001).\u003e","\u003cAn important, commercially available turf grass and probably deliberately introduced to the Arctic islands in several Arctic communities as a potential lawn grass, and to stabilise steep roadsides.\u003e","\u003cTaxonomically, Elven et al. (2003) noted that this is a very complicated complex, \"as indicated for Europe by Markgraf-Dannenberg (1980, Fl. Eur. 5) who recognised about 14 species and split \\i{}F. rubra\\i0{} s.s. into seven subspecies. All ploidy levels from di- to decaploid are reported. There seems, however, to be one main hexaploid entity everywhere in the Arctic, even if it goes by different names (\\i{}arctica\\i0{}, \\i{}cryophila\\i0{}, \\i{}mutica\\i0{}, \\i{}richardsonii\\i0{}). The characters given by Markgraf-Dannenberg also mostly hold true, even if hairiness of the lemmas may vary. The main problem is the other, more southern \u0027races\u0027 that reach the Arctic both as natives in some areas (at least in northern Fennoscandia, Svalbard, southern Greenland, and Alaska) and sometimes as deliberate introductions.\"\\par{}The name \\i{}\u0027arenaria\u0027\\i0{} has been widely used for the major arctic race until fairly recently. All checked records of \\i{}F. arenaria\\i0{} or \\i{}F. rubra\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}arenaria\\i0{} in the Arctic are referrable to \\i{}F. rubra.\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}arctica\\i0{}. Subspecies \\i{}arctica\\i0{} and subsp. \\i{}arenaria\\i0{} have the hairy lemmas in common, but little else. As currently understood, subsp. \\i{}arenaria\\i0{} is confined to western European sand dunes north to southwestern Norway and the southern Baltic, but very far from the Arctic.\\par{}Elven et al. (2003) noted that no exact reference to a type of Hackel\u0027s \\i{}\u0027arctica\u0027\\i0{} had been found whereas there is a clearly identifiable type of Hooker\u0027s \\i{}\u0027richardsonii\u0027\\i0{} (\"Arctic Coast, 1826, new\", leg. Dr. Richardson). This was an argument for using the name subsp. \\i{}richardsonii\\i0{} instead of subsp. \\i{}arctica\\i0{} even if the latter has priority as subspecies. The identity of the Russian \\i{}F. cryophila\\i0{} Krecz. and Bobrov and the North American \\i{}F. richardsonii\\i0{} Hooker with subsp. \\i{}arctica\\i0{} is assumed but not finally proved as long as we have not compared types. \\par{}This entity differs from \\i{}F.rubra\\i0{} s. s. in several characters, partly assumed independent (awn length, lemma hairiness, leaf width and structure), but there is an even transition between subsp. \\i{}arctica\\i0{} and subsp. \\i{}rubra\\i0{} at least in the Fennoscandian area, Greenland and northern Yukon. For this reason the taxon is treated as a subspecies rather than species. The well-documented counts are hexaploid (and possibly octoploid).\u003e","\u003cPorsild (1964) mentions \\i{}F. vivipara\\i0{} (L.) Sm., noting that the Canadian specimens are similar to \\i{}F. baffinensis\\i0{} and \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{}, but the panicle is always proliferous. Frederiksen (1981) stated that \"according to a handwritten note by Holmen, the chromosome number given for Plantae Vasculares Groenlandicae Exsiccatae nr. 22 belongs to the above-mentioned holotype. The number 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 56 was published (Holmen and Laegaard 1960), but re-examination shows 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 49 to be correct, and as far as I know, no other numbers have been known from Greenland... 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 56 was found in material from Alaska and Wrangel Island.\" This species has very often been connected with \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{}, and morphologically it looks very much like this species. In the few cases where anthers were observed, they were about 2 mm. As \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} is very distinct because of its very short anthers, rarely if ever exceeding 1.2 mm (Frederiksen 1977), and as \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} has the leaf sheaths partly split while they are always open in \\i{}F. vivipara\\i0{}, no close connection seems to exist between these two taxa. On the other hand \\i{}F. vivipara\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}glabra\\i0{} seems isolated from the two other subspecies in nearly all examined characters; thus it possibly has another origin.\\par{}A specimen at CAN, which was annotated by Signe Frederiksen in 1987, was collected on Ellesmere Island [Lower Dumbell Lake, the water supply lake for Alert, growing in moist herbmat \\i{}C.R. Harrington 201\\i0{}, August 18, 1959]. An extensive search, in 1992, to find the voucher for the mapped record from Ellesmere Island, Judge Daily Promitory (Frederiksen 1981), was unsuccessful. The specimen from the Canadian Arctic may be an \\i{}F. baffinensis\\i0{} ? \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} hybrid. The plants have very young inflorescences, with few definitive characteristics. Several attempts to obtain fresh material with which to do isozyme experiments have failed. \\par{}\\i{}Festuca vivipara\\i0{} s.s. was interpreted by Alexeev as an offspring from \\i{}F. ovina,\\i0{} alone, or in combination with other species. The triploid chromosome number was interpreted by Frederiksen (1981) as a result of hybridisation between \\i{}F. ovina\\i0{} and \\i{}F. vivipara\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}vivipara\\i0{}. She stated, however, that the triploid plants are morphologically indistinguishable from the tetraploids. They occur independently outside the range of \\i{}F. ovina\\i0{} and form large populations (Salvesen 1986). Triploids may have evolved several times as the hybrid \\i{}F. vivipara\\i0{} ×\\i{}ovina\\i0{}, but most of the southern Norwegian triploids seem to constitute a distinct alpine taxon. Tetraploid \\i{}F. vivipara\\i0{} cannot easily be derived from any ancestral form occurring in Scandinavia today. From morphological and geographical evidence, it therefore seems reasonable to include both triploids and tetraploids (and probably also higher polyploids) in \\i{}F. vivipara\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}vivipara\\i0{} (Elven, in Elven et al. 2003). \\par{}Alexeev (1995) interpreted \\i{}F. viviparoidea\\i0{} as a viviparous offspring of \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{}. \\i{}Festuca viviparoidea\\i0{} is based on subsp. \\i{}glabra\\i0{} and the same type. Frederiksen (1981) explicitly stated that she found \\i{}F. vivipara\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}glabra\\i0{} to belong to the \\i{}\u0027ovina\u0027\\i0{} group, not the \\i{}\u0027brachyphylla\u0027\\i0{} group. Pavlick (1984) reported the anthers, when present, to be of \\i{}\u0027ovina\u0027\\i0{}-group length. It is therefore very improbable that Frederiksen\u0027s subsp. \\i{}glabra\\i0{} (and by implication \\i{}F. viviparoidea\\i0{}) are anything else than a viviparous offspring from the \\i{}F. ovina\\i0{} group rather than the \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} group. Morphologically, the material from northern Siberia (for example, Taimyr), northern Alaska and northwestern Canada differs from the Atlantic \\i{}F. vivipara\\i0{} and might have an origin in the \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} group. It is unlikely that the name \\i{}F. viviparoidea\\i0{} is correctly applied for them. \\par{}Elven et al. (2003) noted that the vegetatively proliferating plants found in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago have affinities with the \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} complex. \\par{}Viviparous plants occur fairly regularly in \u0027continental\u0027 northwestern North America, in British Mountains, and northern Alaska where they form populations, have their own ecology, and behave like a taxon. There may be a gap in the distribution between this area and Greenland, making the identification of the northwestern American plants with \\i{}F. vivipara\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}glabra\\i0{} (and thereby with \\i{}F. viviparoidea\\i0{}) problematic. \\par{}Several attempts to obtain living material of suitable plants from Northern Ellesmere Island have failed. Isozyme analyses of such plants would have been conclusive if they were merely vegetatively proliferating specimens of either \\i{}F. baffinensis\\i0{} or \\i{}F. brachyphylla.\\i0{} The above information is included to draw attention to collections from the Arctic Islands where further study is required to determine the correct taxonomic status.\u003e","\u003cWeimark (1971) distinguished two subspecies: (a) subsp. \\i{}alpina\\i0{}, recognised by these characters: the awn of the upper staminate floret inserted (0.9-)1.3-2.1(-2.5) mm above the lemma base, usually twisted at base (and geniculate), from (b) subsp. \\i{}orthantha\\i0{}, where the awn of the upper male floret is inserted (2.2-)2.6-4.0(-4.5) mm above the lemma base, and is straight. Subspecies \\i{}orthantha\\i0{} has been recorded from Alaska, Greenland, Northern Labrador, and Quebec, but not from the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. \\par{}Veldkamp (in Schouten and Veldcamp 1985) aligned many \\i{}Hierochloë\\i0{} taxa with the genus \\i{}Anthoxanthum\\i0{}, and this subspecies became \\i{}A. monticolum\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}alpinum\\i0{}.\\i{} \\i0{}As this CD was going to press, this combination was taken up by Allred and Barkworth (2007) in \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{}.\u003e","\u003cThis tiny grass often occurs as single plants and is easily overlooked.\\par{}As this CD was going to press, this species was accepted as \\i{}Anthoxanthum arcticum\\i0{} Veldkamp by Allred and Barkworth (2007) in \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{}.\\par{}\u003e","\u003cThis species was first collected in the Arctic islands in 1986, as an apparently accidental introduction at Apex, Frobisher Bay, Baffin Island (63°43\u0027N, 68°27\u0027W), in front of the former Hudson Bay Manager\u0027s house. The first introduction is suspected to have occurred in the late 1960\u0027s when straw was fed to a goat (or was it a pig?) tethered in front of the house. Plants were flourishing when observed in 1986, 1989, and again in 1998. By 2002, they were beginning to spread into a wider area towards the beach at Apex. In 2006, the population of these plants at Apex had been overgrown by a thicket of arctic willow and dense and taller plants of \\i{}Poa pratensis\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}alpigena\\i0{}. It was not found at the site. The species was observed elsewhere in Iqaluit in 2005, by Carolyn Mallory, but it was not at that location in 2006. As in Inuvik, this species may have potential as a lawn grass in Iqaluit. \\par{}The taxon in the Arctic is subsp. \\i{}jubatum\\i0{}. It occurs in the Arctic regions of Alaska, the Yukon, and continental N.W.T.\u003e","\u003cElven (personal communication, 2005) noted that the two subspecies [subsp. \\i{}mollis\\i0{} and subsp. \\i{}villosissimus\\i0{}] are separable (and not always) mainly on one character, that is, the hairs on glumes and lemmas. Their ranges are overlapping (parapatric). They are probably acceptable as geographical races (as done by Soreng et al. 2003) but hardly as species. Specimens from the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, examined by Elven, in Oslo, May 2005, all had soft villous hairs on the glumes and lemmas and were unambiguously subsp. \\i{}villosissimus.\\i0\\par{}This species is a member of the grass tribe Triticeae, where there has been much discussion about generic alignments; see, for example, the synonymy for \\i{}Elymus alaskanus\\i0{}. \\par{}Elven et al. (2003) noted that \"the separation of \\i{}L. mollis\\i0{} and \\i{}L. arenarius\\i0{} at species level is probably justified on a combination of morphological and ploidal differences, even if the morphological differences are few and all the hairiness characters may be genetically interconnected.\" The taxon in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago is \\i{}L.\\i0{} \\i{}mollis\\i0{}. On continental North America, \\i{}L. mollis\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}villosissimus\\i0{} A. Löve and D. Löve has been recognised [Bot. Not. 128: 503. 1976], but subspecies within \\i{}L. mollis\\i0{} are difficult to recognise clearly on morphological evidence, as the differences mostly are quantitative. In northern Alaska and Canada, subsp. \\i{}mollis\\i0{} and subsp. \\i{}villosissimus\\i0{} are sympatric and not easy to distinguish. \\par{}Heagy and Cooke (1979) studied the vegetation at a Lesser Snow Goose [\\i{}Anser caerulescens caerulescens\\i0{}] breeding colony to determine if particular plant species or species associations were characteristic of the nest sites of the geese. A stepwise discriminant analysis revealed that nest sites could be satisfactorily distinguished from the ambient vegetation using 2 of the 29 plant species growing in the quadrats. These two species, lyme grass (\\i{}Leymus mollis\\i0{}) and arctic daisy (\\i{}Arctanthemum arcticum\\i0{} (L.) Tzvelev subsp. \\i{}polare\\i0{}), were strongly associated with Snow Goose nest sites. Possible explanations for the association are examined. Rather than a cause and effect relationship between plants and nest sites, it was suggested that \\i{}L. mollis\\i0{} and \\i{}A. arcticum\\i0{} apparently have similar ecological requirements to those of the geese for a nesting site.\u003e","\u003cThis species was deliberately introduced to Baffin Island, early this century (before 2005). Along with \\i{}Festuca rubra\\i0{} it was a major component in a mixture of grass seed that was used to hydro-seed the hillside in front of the hospital in Iqaluit. The mixture was also used in a planting on locally produced compost that was placed on the same hillside in the form of a large \"C\". The compost remained in position, and the \"C\" contains a mixture of plants of \\i{}Lolium\\i0{} and \\i{}Festuca\\i0{}. Seeds in the hydroseeded mixture did not remain in position at the top of the hill, or on the slope, but washed off and accumulated at the junction between the disturbed gravel and the tundra. Here they formed a lush zone of these introduced species. The occurrence of Lolium in hamlets in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago may become more widespread if hydro-seeding is used more extensively. \\par{}Ryegrass is one of the few \"throw and grow\" seeds that can be sown without the hassle of tilling, scarifying, or digging into the soil and destroying any of the permanent ground covers already in place. Perennial \\par{}\\i{}Lolium perenne\\i0{}, a Eurasian species, is commercially important, being included in lawn seed mixtures as well as being used for forage and erosion prevention. \\i{}Lolium perenne\\i0{} and \\i{}L. multiflorum\\i0{} are interfertile and intergrade. \\i{}Lolium multiflorum \\i0{}differs from \\i{}L. perenne\\i0{} in being a taller, shorter lived perennial with wider leaves that are rolled, rather than folded, in the bud. Hybrids between the two species are called \\i{}Lolium ×hybridum\\i0{} Hausskn. \\par{} \\i{}Lolium multiflorum\\i0{}, a European species, now grows in most of North America. It is planted as a cover crop, as a temporary lawn grass, for roadside restoration, and for soil or forage enrichment; it often escapes from cultivation, becoming established in disturbed sites (Mary Barkworth, personal communication, 2006, based on E. Terrell\u0027s treatment of the genus for \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{}).\u003e","\u003cCanadian specimens of \\i{}Phippsia\\i0{} that have lemmas with a few conspicuous hairs towards the base, but do not otherwise conform to \\i{}P. concinna\\i0{}, may be assigned to f. \\i{}vestita\\i0{} Holmb. \\par{}Grulke and Bliss (1988), in a study of comparative life history characteristics of two High Arctic grasses, noted that \\i{}Phippsia algida\\i0{} is a ruderal species that colonises bare soil in mesic sites, but also occurs across a broad range of habitats. \\i{}Phippsia\\i0{} was observed to experience more frequent and severe drought stress at less extreme physical conditions than \\i{}Puccinellia vaginata\\i0{}, the species it was being compared with. Drought stress and low temperatures reduced whole plant biomass of \\i{}Phippsia\\i0{} of all ages in the study. Grulke and Bliss (1988) found that \\i{}Phippsia\\i0{} was relatively short-lived (living on average 23 years and a maximum of 34 years). They noted that the mean age of initial reproduction was relatively late when compared to temperate species, that is, 17 ± 6 years. Under all the field conditions monitored \\i{}Phippsia\\i0{} had high, constant seed set. In short growing seasons, \\i{}Phippsia\\i0{} continued high carbon allocation to reproduction, but also had high rates of plant mortality. The authors concluded that \\i{}Phippsia algida\\i0{} has many characteristics of a ruderal and fills this role in a High Arctic ecosystem. \\par{}Bell and Bliss (1978) estimated that the roots of \\i{}P. algida\\i0{} live 1.5 years. On three separate occasions Aiken has found plants of \\i{}Phippsia\\i0{} to be one of the most difficult grasses to transplant to a greenhouse in the south. Although several plants were brought south, they did not survive more than 2-3 weeks after being removed from an arctic environment. The late Dr. Eilif Dahl and students investigated this plant and found it to be very susceptible to high temperatures. Its lethal temperature limit was lower than for most other arctic-alpine plants. It is therefore not surprising that it did not survive transplantation in the south (Elven, personal communication, 2005).\\par{}This species is possibly the first arctic grass to flower and set seed and appears to do so before mid-August in most habitats. On Herschel Island in July 1988, \\i{}Phippsia\\i0{} had flowered and was setting seed before other grasses in the area were at anthesis. \\par{}In the former Soviet Union this species is considered to produce good pasture plants when fertilised (Tzvelev 1976). In Canada, the usually small plants, 5-10 cm high, are larger when they receive additional nutrients; see, for example, plants growing near the sewage lagoon in Iqaluit. \\par{}Aares et al. (2000) studied phylogeographic and taxonomic relations among 54 North Atlantic populations of \\i{}Phippsia\\i0{} using isozyme techniques and genetically based morphological variation and found that their results supported the recognition of two distinct species, \\i{}P. algida\\i0{} and \\i{}P. concinna\\i0{}, the latter with at least two subspecies. They stated that both of these self-fertilising arctic pioneer species were genetic allotetraploids almost without intra-populational variation. Also, the two species showed strikingly different phylogeographies in the North Atlantic region in spite of their similarity in morphology, habitat ecology, mating system, and dispersal ecology, and in spite of their present co-occurrence in many geographic areas, sometimes even in the same snowbeds. The same electrophoretic multilocus phenotype was observed in all populations of \\i{}P. algida\\i0{}, and although this species showed considerable morphological variation, the variation was unstructured geographically. They concluded that \\i{}P. algida\\i0{} showed a pattern similar to other arctic species investigated in the North Atlantic region and that it has probably dispersed postglacially across the sea barriers between Greenland, Svalbard, Iceland, and Scandinavia. In contrast, \\i{}P. concinna\\i0{} was virtually fixed for different multilocus phenotypes in the three main geographic areas analysed (southern and northern Norway, Svalbard, Greenland), corresponding to fairly distinct divergence in morphology. The pattern suggested (i) absence of postglacial, between area dispersal in this species, and (ii) that it may have immigrated to the North Atlantic region from different source areas and/or survived the last glaciation \\i{}in situ.\\par{}\\i0{}Steen et al. (2004) reported on evidence from Svalbard plants for the hybrid origin of the arctic × \\i{}Pucciphippsia vacillans\\i0{} (Poaceae).\u003e","\u003cThe Greenland records for \\i{}P. concinna\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}algidiformis\\i0{} reported from here by Bay (1993) [Nord. J. Bot. 13: 1-40] were examined in Oslo (by Elven and Aiken, May 2005), and all collections from northern Greenland were assigned to \\i{}P. concinna.\\i0{} They are usually prostrate or erect plants, with only slightly spreading inflorescences. Similar specimens were found from Ellesmere Island at O. It was at that time concluded that \\i{}P. concinna\\i0{} is present in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and it is included in the \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{} treatment (Consaul and Aiken 2007). \\par{}The name \\ldblquote\\i{}algidiformis\\i0\\rdblquote{} was first used by Harry Smith (1914) for an isolated population of \\i{}P. concinna\\i0{} plants that grow in the mountains between Sweden and Norway. His type is at UPS, with isotype in O. He later synonymised these plants under \\i{}P. concinna\\i0{}, indicating he no longer recognised the taxon he described Tzvelev (1976/1983). \\par{}An Alaska record from Hultén (1950) is from St. Lawrence Island (a mixed collection of \\i{}P. algida\\i0{} and \\i{}P. concinna\\i0{}, leg. Kjellman 1879, S).\u003e","\u003cThis species has the most northern distribution for an emergent grass. Data for Canadian samples suggests some specimens are larger plants than those that occur in northern Europe. The taxon was named for the Arctic explorer Edward Sabine. The spelling of \\i{}\"sabinii\"\\i0{} appears to have been a deliberate Latinising of the name by Robert Brown, and according to the \\i{}International Code of Botanical Nomenclature\\i0{}, Articles 60,1 and 60,11, the spelling should be corrected (Greuter et al. 1994).\u003e","\u003cThere has been constant agreement that this is a distinct species (Porsild 1964, Edmondson 1980, Tzvelev 1976). All specimens examined from the Canadian Arctic Islands belong to subsp. \\i{}abbreviata\\i0{} (Soreng, personal communication, 1991). A second subspecies, \\i{}P. abbreviata\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}pattersonii \\i0{}(Vasey) A. and D. Löve and Kapoor, is found in northwestern North America, but has not been found on the Canadian Arctic Islands. Tzvelev (1976) also recognised subsp. \\i{}jordalii\\i0{} (A.E. Porsild) Hultén, but this subspecies is now considered a synonym of \\i{}P. abbreviata\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}pattersonii\\i0{} (Vasey) A. and D. Löve and Kapoor, by Soreng (1991).\u003e","\u003cThis taxon is readily distinguished from other Arctic \\i{}Poa\\i0{} species by its broad leaves that are nearly uniformly wide until they are abruptly contracted at the apex, the build-up of a \"thick sock\" (or its \"booties\") of old sheaths at the base of the plant, and by the relatively large spikelets that often seem to cause the branches to droop. \\par{}Polunin (1940) commented that no viviparous forms were found in the Canadian Arctic. Porsild (1957, 1964) and Porsild and Cody (1980), however, describe \\i{}P. alpina\\i0{} as viviparous, particularly in the Canadian Eastern Arctic. Viviparous or vegetatively proliferating specimens substantiating this statement have not been found in CAN or DAO, or recently collected. They are, however, common in northern Europe (R. Elven, personal communication). Viviparous \\i{}P. alpina\\i0{} is treated as a variety, \\i{}P. alpina\\i0{} var. \\i{}vivipara\\i0{} L., by Elven et al. (2003), and as a subspecies by Soreng et al. (2003). \\par{}\\i{}Poa alpina\\i0{} was found to be an early coloniser of oil spills in Alaska (Kershaw and Kershaw 1986).\u003e","\u003cA widespread, relatively distinct species, \\i{}Poa arctica\\i0{} is considered highly polymorphic (Tzvelev 1976; Edmondson 1980). Tzvelev (1976) claimed that it is probably represented in the former Soviet Union by several, still unidentified subspecies with different chromosome numbers. In Svalbard, proliferating and non-proliferating entities are about equally frequent and the non-proliferating ones seem to be highly agamospermic, often with shrivelled anthers and undeveloped pollen (see also Notes for \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}caespitans\\i0{}). \\par{}Tzvelev (1976) commented that the rarely found viviparous variety \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} var. \\i{}vivipara\\i0{} Hooker is probably the hybrid between \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} × \\i{}P. pratensis\\i0{} s.l., which is not always distinguishable from some forms of \\i{}P. pratensis\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}colpodea\\i0{} (Th. Fr.) Tzvelev. Porsild (1955) suggested that most viviparous High Arctic \\i{}Poa\\i0{} is best placed in \\i{}P\\i0{}. \\i{}arctica\\i0{} as var. \\i{}vivipara\\i0{}, but unfortunately without explanation. Porsild (1957, 1964) and Porsild and Cody (1980) mapped \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} var. \\i{}vivipara\\i0{} in 18 different localities throughout the Eastern Arctic. We have not been able to verify any of these records. Upon examination of herbarium specimens at CAN and DAO, none were located at CAN, while the several specimens found at DAO were redetermined as \\i{}P\\i0{}. \\i{}pratensis\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}colpodea\\i0{}. Gillespie and Boles (2001) concluded that \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} var. \\i{}vivipara\\i0{} is not present on the Canadian Arctic Islands based on their present understanding of arctic \\i{}Poa\\i0{} taxa.\\par{}Gillespie and Boles (2001) noted that \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} is a highly polymorphic species in the Canadian Arctic, and as this variation is far from being discrete morphologically or geographically, they questioned the validity and utility of recognising infraspecific taxa. They agreed with Polunin (1940) that there appears to be so much variation, and plants vary \"in such a mixed and baffling manner that I have given up on sorting out the more obvious traits\". One of these morphotypes (included here under \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}arctica\\i0{}) is a low cushion or clumped form found in cold wet seepages and meadows at higher elevations in the High Arctic (see image library).\u003e","\u003cThis subspecies has been recognised by Elven et al. (2003) for the Panarctic Flora and tentatively by Soreng et al. (2003) for North America. Mentioned by Porsild (1964) under species comments on \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{}, along with comments on \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} var. \\i{}vivipara\\i0{} Hooker, as a well-marked eastern arctic taxon. Tzvelev (1976), following Roshevitz (1932), suggested that this may be a hybrid between \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} × \\i{}P. glauca\\i0{}. Genetically, \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}caespitans\\i0{} seems to be simpler, with fewer molecular markers, e.g., less enzyme multilocus phenotypes, at least in Svalbard (Haugen 2000), and at a lower ploidal level than most of \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}arctica\\i0{}. It seems to be constantly octoploid, whereas most voucher-supported counts of \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} s. str. - at least from the amphi-Atlantic areas - are at 9\\i{}x\\i0{} or higher (Elven et al. 2003). Gillespie and Boles (2001) and Gillespie et al. (2005, and unpublished data) did not find cpDNA sequence or restriction site variation distinguishing it from subsp. \\i{}arctica\\i0{}.\\par{}While Nannfeldt (1940) claimed that he had not seen fertile anthers in this taxon, Porsild (1964) noted that the anthers never contain good pollen. However, inflorescences on herbarium specimens from the Canadian Arctic Archipelago that are housed at CAN, and that were annotated by R.J. Soreng in 1990, have fully developed, but not necessarily fertile, anthers. \\par{}Specimens of the Canadian Arctic complex that have been called subsp. \\i{}caespitans\\i0{} are densely tufted, only occasionally rhizomatous, with flat, soft leaves. Porsild (1964) provided distribution maps of both \\i{}Poa arctica\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}caespitans\\i0{} and \\i{}Poa arctica\\i0{} var. \\i{}vivipara\\i0{} Hooker, but did not indicate how he distinguished them. Löve and Löve (1975) followed Roshevitz (1932) and listed the taxon as having 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 56, on 12 counts, which contrasts with 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 60-88 that they give for \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} s.s. \\par{}The name has been put into synonomy under \\i{}P. tolmatchewii\\i0{} Roshevitz by Tzvelev (1976), following Roshevitz (1932) who suggested that the taxon may be a hybrid \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} × \\i{}P. glauca\\i0{}. In annotating specimens at CAN in 1990, R.J. Soreng, Smithsonian University, recognised \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} and \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}caespitans\\i0{}. In 1995, he explained that subsp. \\i{}caespitans\\i0{} is not a well-defined taxon. It may not be diagnosable using the attributes scabrous branches and more open sheaths, but it appears to be intermediate between \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} and other species and may represent hybrids and the products of backcrossing. \\par{}Recent field studies (1999) have shown that there appears to be at least two densely tufted \\i{}Poa\\i0{} taxa in the Canadian Arctic Islands. One, found in mesic stony habitats, and generally considered to be \\i{}P\\i0{}. \\i{}arctica\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}caespitans\\i0{}, has mostly robust plants with broad flat leaves and often tall flowering culms. The other found in cold moist to wet areas at higher elevations has low mound-forming plants with short culms. \\par{}Haugen (2000) tested two of Tzvelev\u0027s hypotheses about the hybrid origins of taxa in \\i{}Poa\\i0{}, using material collected in Svalbard. The entities investigated and compared in her thesis were \\i{}P. abbreviata\\i0{}, \\i{}P. alpigena\\i0{} viviparous type, \\i{}P. alpigena\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}colpodea\\i0{}, \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}arctica\\i0{}, \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}cespitans\\i0{}, \\i{}P. glauca\\i0{}, and \\i{}P. hartzii\\i0{}. The investigation concerned morphology (about 50 characters), biological reproductive characteristics, and isoenzymes as genetic markers. The samples of \\i{}P. alpigena\\i0{} and \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} investigated were insufficiently separated in most morphological characters (except the lemma hairiness) and also less distinct in isoenzymes than would be expected of two \u0027species\u0027 from different aggregates. \\i{}Poa arctica\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}cespitans\\i0{} was slightly more distinct from \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}arctica\\i0{} in morphology than the latter was from \\i{}P. alpigena\\i0{}. \\i{}Poa arctica\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}cespitans\\i0{} was also distinct enzymatically although most closely related to \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}arctica\\i0{}. \\i{}Poa alpigena\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}colpodea\\i0{} was fairly distinct, both morphologically and enzymatically. In morphology, it was a little more distant from \u0027normal\u0027 \\i{}P. alpigena\\i0{} than the latter was from \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}arctica\\i0{}. In enzymes, however, \\i{}P. alpigena\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}colpodea\\i0{} was closer to \\i{}P. alpigena\\i0{} s.s. than to \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{}. The Svalbard plants of \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}arctica\\i0{} corresponded very well both with the type material (Melville Island) and with material collected in Melville Island in 1999. They obviously belong to the \u0027type\u0027 subspecies. Plants of \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}cespitans\\i0{} from Svalbard are generally morphologically quite similar to Simmons\u0027 type collections from Ellesmere Island and also to plants from Greenland named as \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}cespitans\\i0{}. \\i{}Poa alpigena\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}colpodea\\i0{} was described from Svalbard, and the plants Hagen (2000) investigated corresponded to the type and to plants named as such from arctic North America. What these results imply is that it is difficult to separate between the aggregates around \\i{}Poa arctica\\i0{} and \\i{}P. pratensis.\\i0\\par{}Gillespie and Boles (2001) found no evidence for \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}caespitans\\i0{} as a taxon distinct from \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}arctica \\i0{}on chloroplast DNA evidence, as individuals examined all had the same cpDNA haplotype. Nor was there evidence that it might be a hybrid between \\i{}P. arctica \\i0{}and\\i{} P. glauca\\i0{} either on the cpDNA evidence or from observations made during field work, but they state that further DNA studies are needed to investigate possible independent lineages suggested by morphological differences. \\par{}In northern Norway and Svalbard, \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}arctica\\i0{} regularly has some pollen, whereas no pollen development has been found in specimens of \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}caespitans\\i0{} in which agamospermy and proliferation seems to be nearly obligate (R. Elven, personal communication, 1999).\u003e","\u003cThis is a very widespread species that looks rather different in cold sectors of the Arctic, as stunted plants only reach 10-15 cm high and have a spike-like inflorescence. Caryopses are rarely formed in High Arctic plants because of the short growing season. \\par{}Elven et al. (2003) considered that \\i{}P. glauca\\i0{} is fairly homogeneous in most northern arctic areas. It becomes much more variable further south in the transition from tundra to forest, boreal mountain ranges, and possibly in the amphi-Beringian area. They suggested that much of the variation is probably caused by hybridisation and will be difficult or impossible to classify satisfactorily.\u003e","\u003cField observations, morphological evidence, and germination trials reported in Gillespie et al. (1997) support \\i{}P. hartzii\\i0{} as a morphologically distinct apomictic species that reproduces by seed. DNA evidence in the same paper provides evidence for two possible origins of \\i{}P. hartzii\\i0{}. The first is a hybrid origin between two ancestral species. The second, and more likely, is that \\i{}P. hartzii\\i0{} was an existing species that \"captured\" DNA from a second species, \\i{}P. glauca \\i0{}(Gillespie et al. 1997). Recent molecular evidence supports the second hypothesis, since \\i{}P. hartzii\\i0{} has a unique cpDNA haplotype within the \\i{}P.\\i0{} sect. \\i{}Secundae \\i0{}group (Gillespie and Boles 2001, Gillespie and Soreng 2005). Individuals of \\i{}P. hartzii\\i0{},\\i{} \\i0{}having a haplotype identical to that of \\i{}P. glauca \\i0{}(widespread in Arctic Canada), were found only in High Arctic sites and are postulated to result from hybridisation and introgression.\\par{}\\i{}Poa hartzii\\i0{} was previously thought to be possibly \\i{}P. abbreviata\\i0{} or \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} × \\i{}P. glauca\\i0{}. Cayouette (1984) recorded a collection of \\i{}P. hartzii\\i0{} from northern Quebec and summarised the debate concerning this taxon, pointing out that Sørensen (1953), Holmen (1957), and Porsild (1964) considered it a species. According to Sørensen (1933), \"Even if \\i{}Poa Hartzii\\i0{} is thus intermediate in many respects between \\i{}P. abbreviata\\i0{} and \\i{}P. glauca\\i0{}, it hardly represents the hybrid between these two species\". Jørgensen et al. (1958) noted that individuals of \\i{}P. hartzii\\i0{} in Greenland showed meiotic irregularities and formed abnormal pollen but developed good seeds that lead them to conclude that the taxon was apomictic. Scholander (1934) observed \\i{}P. hartzii\\i0{} to be intermediate between \\i{}P. abbreviata\\i0{} and \\i{}P. glauca\\i0{}, whereas Nannfeldt (1935) suggested that it may be the hybrid \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} × \\i{}P. abbreviata\\i0{}. Edmondson (1980) treated it as a stabilised, but apparently sterile, hybrid of \\i{}P. abbreviata\\i0{} × \\i{}P. glauca\\i0{}. Soreng (1991) discussed \\i{}P. hartzii\\i0{} as a species that possibly had a hybrid origin. \\par{}In Svalbard, this taxon sometimes forms stands over large areas (tens of kilometres) with well-defined individuals (1000-10000, at least), where it is obviously seed-propagated, even though it flowers late. It appears to be agamospermic, as no evidence of fertile pollen has been found, agreeing with the North American findings given above (R. Elven, personal communication, 1999). \\par{}Haugen (2000) investigated possible hybrid origins of \\i{}Poa hartzii\\i0{} and \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}caespitans\\i0{} in Svalbard, using morphological and isozyme techniques. In the populations studied she found \\i{}P. hartzii\\i0{} was enzymatically non-varying and had a unique multilocus phenotype and most similar to \\i{}P. glauca\\i0{}.\u003e","\u003cThis taxon is distinct and relatively common in the eastern Canadian High Arctic. It has a chloroplast DNA haplotype that is distinct from that of the southern subsp. \\i{}pratensis\\i0{} (Gillespie and Boles 2001). It was treated as a full species \\i{}Poa alpigena \\i0{}by Porsild (1955) and Edmondson (1980) and as a subspecies by Tzvelev (1976). Porsild (1955) claimed that Canadian specimens agreed well with specimens from northeastern Greenland and also with the excellent description and illustrations given by Scholander (1934).\\par{}Elven et al. (2003) noted that most taxa of the \\i{}P. pratensis\\i0{} aggregate are more or less apomictic with both agamospermy and bulbil propagation (many studies from Müntzing 1932, 1940 onwards). Some reticulation is at least probable, and the limits between entities (agamospecies) are often unclear. There are several bulbil-reproducing plants in the \\i{}\u0027alpigena\u0027\\i0{} affinity. In Svalbard and Greenland, several biotypes of subsp. \\i{}alpigena\\i0{} (described as var. \\i{}vivipara\\i0{}) are much more common than is subsp. \\i{}colpodea\\i0{}. In the Canadian Arctic viviparous plants of subsp. \\i{}alpigena\\i0{} have been observed on Melville Island, but are generally less common and widespread than subsp. \\i{}colpodea\\i0{}.\u003e","\u003cHaugen (2000) tested two of Tzvelev\u0027s hypotheses about the hybrid origins of taxa in \\i{}Poa\\i0{} using material collected in Svalbard. The entities investigated and compared in her thesis were \\i{}P. abbreviata\\i0{}, \\i{}P. alpigena\\i0{} viviparous type, \\i{}P. alpigena\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}colpodea\\i0{}, \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}arctica\\i0{}, \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}cespitans\\i0{}, \\i{}P. glauca\\i0{}, and \\i{}P. hartzii\\i0{}.

(2003) accepted subsp. \\i{}colpodea\\i0{} but circumscribed it widely and included, e.g., \\i{}\"P. alpigena\\i0{} var. \\i{}vivipara\"\\i0{}. Here we consider viviparous \\i{}P. pratensis\\i0{} supbsp. \\i{}alpigena\\i0{} as distinct from \\i{}P. pratensis\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}colpodea\\i0{}.\u003e","\u003cSwallen (1944) said that this is a rather distinct species in which the long decumbent base, short, stiffly spreading panicle branches, and acute, more or less toothed lemmas, are characteristic. He considered that close relationships with other arctic species were not evident. \\par{}Consaul and Gillespie (2001) found some confusion with the Canadian isotype specimen of \\i{}P. andersonii\\i0{}. Swallen (1944) reported in his protologue discussion of \\i{}P. andersonii\\i0{} that the original collection by Anderson was composed of two species: \\i{}P. andersonii\\i0{}, which became sheet 4399a and the type, and \\i{}P. paupercula\\i0{} (\u003d \\i{}P. langeana\\i0{}), which became sheet 4399b. During the separation of the two species some specimens of \\i{}P. langeana\\i0{} were apparently transferred to the Canada isotype, 4399a. Consaul and Gillespie annotated the \\i{}P. andersonii\\i0{} isotype specimens as 4399a-1, and the \\i{}P. langeana\\i0{} specimens as 4399a-2. The same problem does not occur with the holotype (US ex NA). Consaul and Gillespie (2001) found that the isotype (i.e., 4399a-1, \\i{}P. andersonii\\i0{}) and two other \\i{}P. andersonii\\i0{} specimens were smaller and less hairy than all the other collections of \\i{}P. andersonii\\i0{} examined in the PCoA, and clustered with \\i{}P. langeana\\i0{} in cluster analyses the former three specimens fell between the rest of the \\i{}P. andersonii\\i0{} specimens and \\i{}P. langeana\\i0{}. This has led to the question of whether there are two taxa represented by the \\i{}P. andersonii\\i0{} specimens analysed, and this is part of a study being undertaken by Consaul (2002-2006).\\par{}Sørensen (1953) described the lemma as entire, but in several Canadian specimens annotated by him, we observed the lemmas are erose. When described, \\i{}Puccinellia andersonii\\i0{} was known only from the type locality, Pt. Lay, Arctic central Alaska. Sørensen (1953) indicated that it occurs over northern Greenland [southward to about 70°N on the west coast and to about 73°N on the east coast] and suggested that it had previously been mistaken for \\i{}Puccinellia angustata\\i0{}, or in some cases for \\i{}Puccinellia (Colpodium\\i0{})\\i{} vahlianum\\i0{}. He noted that while the species grow in similar habitats, no direct connection between \\i{}P. andersonii\\i0{} and \\i{}P. angustata\\i0{} seemed to exist. Consaul and Gillespie (2001) had made observations in 1997-1999 in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and confirmed that there \\i{}P. andersonii\\i0{} and \\i{}P. angustata\\i0{} do grow in similar habitats and do appear different. When plants of each species were growing near each other they were at similar stages of phenology. These authors confirmed the observation of Grulke and Bliss (1988) that like \\i{}P. vaginata\\i0{} the inflorescences remain prostrate when sexually mature. They even suspected that occasionally \\i{}P. angustata\\i0{} was collected preferentially to \\i{}P. andersonii\\i0{} because in the latter the whole plant was often prostrate, looking like a \"less healthy\" plant. Although this is a relatively distinct taxon, specimens are found that have characteristics of \\i{}P. langeana\\i0{}, if very glabrous, and \\i{}P. vaginata\\i0{} if more hairy (Consaul and Gillespie 2001). \\par{}Although never previously considered to be closely related, when plants\\i{} \\i0{}of \\i{}P. andersonii\\i0{} and \\i{}P. vaginata\\i0{} were growing together they were not always easy to distinguish on the character lemmas \"erose-ciliolate\" (Sørensen 1953). Consaul and Gillespie (2001) found that these two taxa, as currently recognised, overlap morphologically. Some specimens considered to be \\i{}P. andersonii, \\i0{}since the apices of the lemmas and glumes are erose and acute, had unusually long trichomes on the lemma and glume margins, and in this they approach \\i{}P. vaginata\\i0{}. Other specimens were considered intermediate between \\i{}P. andersonii\\i0{} and \\i{}P. vaginata\\i0{} in the anther lengths, suggested as distinct in Porsild (1964) [\\i{}P. vaginata\\i0{}, 0.6-0.8 mm long: \\i{}P. andersonii\\i0{},\\i{} \\i0{}0.8-1.0 mm long].\u003e","\u003cIn the Canadian records this is the most commonly collected species on the Arctic islands. Cayouette and Blondeau, 1996, recorded the occurrence of \\i{}P. angustata\\i0{} s.s. in Nunavik (northern Quebec).\\par{}Sørensen (1953) suggested that although variation in this taxon is considerable, he did not consider it justified to recognise more than one entity. Elven et al. (2003) drew attention to \\i{}Puccinellia angustata\\i0{} (R.Br.) E.L. Rand and Redfield var. \\i{}decumbens\\i0{} Jørg. ex T.J. Sørensen, Meddel. Grønl. 136, 3: 30. 1953, based on the type from Svalbard: Spitsbergen, Advent Bay, East side, 21.07.1896, leg. E. Jørgensen (O, C). They noted that this variety is fairly distinct even where it co-occurs with the type variety in Svalbard. Jørgensen did not publish the name (only noted it on herbarium labels), so the correct citation is probably \u0027Jørg. ex T.J.

In loose, windblown, riverbank sand, such as found along the MacDonald River Delta near Tanquary Fiord on Ellesmere Island, plants were found that were almost completely erect, possibly as a response to being slowly buried by sand. \\par{}The character states that have been used to key out this species have differed, depending on the author. Sørensen (1953) used the character lemmas erose-ciliolate; Porsild and Cody (1980) describe the lemmas as tapering, commonly with hyaline tips. Consaul and Gillespie (2001) described and illustrated small, acuminate trichomes, which render the margins of the glumes and lemmas scabrous or scaberulous. \\par{}Sørensen (1955) considered \\i{}P. bruggemannii\\i0{} easily mistaken for stunted \\i{}P. angustata\\i0{}, but indicated that they differ in leaf epidermal characters, indicating that \\i{}P. angustata\\i0{} usually has stomates and \\i{}P. bruggemannii\\i0{} does not. In Consaul\u0027s (2002-2006) systematic study of arctic \\i{}Puccinellia\\i0{}, stomates were not examined because Tzvelev (1964) noted a lot of within-species variation in this character. Variation in this character should be examined after the species limits have been clarified.

In 1997, Consaul and Gillespie (personal observations) reported this taxon under the name \\i{}P. borealis\\i0{} as abundant and weedy on Victoria Island.

By 1985, the lake bed was dry in most areas and wind erosion was extensive.\u003e","\u003cBowden (1961) considered this taxon to be a sterile, triploid hybrid of unknown parentage. Sørensen (1953) recognised four variants of \\i{}P. phryganodes\\i0{}, based on pedicels thickened or not thickened, floret numbers per spikelet, lemma lengths, and epidermal cell features. He concluded that Canadian material is mainly the \"Greenland type\" (\u003d \\i{}P. phryganodes\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}neoarctica\\i0{}), but generally with better developed pistils. Tzvelev (1976) recognised various subspecies, but remarked that none of them is morphologically clearly separated, and they may not deserve recognition. The description by Hughes and Halliday (1980) differs from the one given here, in the following characters: \"spikelets not more than 4 florets; lower glume 1.2-1.7 mm, upper glume 1.5-2.3 mm; lemma 1.5-2.5 mm\". The Hughes and Halliday (1980) description is based on northern Norwegian plants, i.e., triploids with even more reduced florets and anthers (or the pale shadows of very clearly aborted anthers) (R. Elven, personal communication, 1999). \\par{}In the Panarctic Flora checklist, Elven et al. (2003) followed the concept of Tzvelev (1976) on the variation in the \\i{}\u0027phryganodes\u0027\\i0{} aggregate, noting that the morphological differences seem constant (albeit small) and are partly associated with ploidy differences. The entities they suggest represented major geographical allopatric or parapatric races, and qualified as subspecies in their concepts. This treatment suggested the following subspecies:\\par{}\\i{}Puccinellia phryganodes\\i0{} (Trin.) Scribn. and Merr. subsp. \\i{}phryganodes\\i0{} as most probably a tetraploid, 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 28, that occurs in the Russian Far East and Alaska. The plants investigated of this entity in W and NW Alaska are also fully pollen-fertile, in opposition to most or all plants elsewhere. We have investigated plants also from the type region (\"Kotzebue Sund\"). The W-NW Alaskan entity (\\i{}phryganodes\\i0{} s. str.) is tetraploid (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 28) (Elven, personal communication, 2005).\\par{}\\i{}Puccinellia phryganodes\\i0{} (Trin.)

In 2005, Elven et al. (2005) treated this taxon as a separate species. \\par{}Following Elven et al. (2003) we draw attention to this discussion, but as some of the combinations have not been published, we do not follow it yet (March 2005). \\par{}Jefferies and Gottlieb (1983) studied genetic variation within and between populations of \\i{}Puccinellia phryganodes\\i0{}. Because they assumed that the taxon is a sterile triploid, they expected that the level of genetic variation would be low, both within and between populations. They examined the electrophoretic mobilities of isozymes of 12 systems in plants from three widely separated populations in Arctic Canada (La Prouse Bay, Manitoba, 58°4\u0027N, 94°4\u0027W; Tuktoyaktuk, N.W.T. 69°27\u0027N, 133°00\u0027W; and Alexandra Fiord, Ellesmere Island, Nunavut 78°53\u0027N, 75°55\u0027W) and found a high level of variability both within and between populations. They suggested that the unexpected discovery of significant amounts of genetic variability indicated that sexual processes occur in this species. \\par{}Siira and Merila (1985), working in Finland, found that around the coast of Bothnian Bay, in the Baltic Sea area, the populations of \\i{}P. phryganodes\\i0{} had decreased greatly during the previous 20 years. They noted that the species has \"a narrow ecological amplitude and poor colonization ability\", and suggested that in some areas, continuous land uplift causes fairly rapid changes in the ecological conditions, and primary succession is not always the same. They also noted that human activity had influenced the nature of the shorelines studied.\u003e","\u003cThe description given here is based on a limited number of specimens available and supplemented by description in J.I. Davis (1983). He considered that \\i{}P. pumila\\i0{} is exclusively coastal and can be distinguished from other species in the \\i{}P. nuttalliana\\i0{} complex by the entire, erose, or sparsely scabrous margin of the lemma, as opposed to the predominantly scabrous margin typical of the other three species (\\i{}P. grandis\\i0{} Swallen, \\i{}P. nutkaensis\\i0{} (J. Presl) Fernald and Weath., and \\i{}P. nuttalliana\\i0{} (Schult.) Hitchc.). \\ldblquote{}It is more glabrous overall than any other species in the complex\" (Davis 1983). \\par{}McJannet et al. (1993) followed Kartesz (1994) and used \\i{}P. kurilensis\\i0{} (Takeda) Honda for members of this taxon. J.I. Davis was not prepared to consider North American \\i{}P. pumila\\i0{} synonymous with \\i{}P. kurilensis\\i0{} (personal communication, 1994); Davis and Soreng (2003) have excluded the name \\i{}P. kurilensis \\i0{}from the New World Grass flora. \\i{}Puccinellia pumila\\i0{} is recognised in the \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{} treatment (Davis and Consaul 2007).\u003e","\u003cThe description given here is based on specimens that were annotated by T.J. Sørensen as subsp. \\i{}typica\\i0{}. Sørensen (1953) stated that the taxonomy and nomenclature of this taxon were disputed from the time it was first recognised as \\i{}Glyceria langeana\\i0{} Berlin. He recognised the specimens from North America as subsp. \\i{}typica\\i0{}, distinct from those in Asia (subsp. \\i{}asiatica\\i0{} T.J. Sørensen) and Alaska (subsp. \\i{}alaskana\\i0{} (Scribn. and Merr.) T.J. Sørensen). He commented that the epidermis of the leaves of the \\i{}P. langeana\\i0{} group is unusual when compared with other arctic \\i{}Puccinellia\\i0{} species because there are relatively few stomata on the underside of the leaf and the leaf margins are finely crenulate from short, rounded, marginal cells.\\par{}This taxon was distinguished by the absence of hairs on the callus, lemma base, and palea. However, some specimens annotated by Sørensen as this taxon were found to have a ring of small callus hairs, to 0.05 mm long (Consaul and Gillespie 2001). These specimens are still readily separated from the other \\i{}Puccinellia\\i0{} species in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago by the size and lack of hairs on the almost completely glabrous plants and in usually having no trichomes on the margins of the lemmas or glumes (see image library). \\par{}In multivariate analyses, small very slightly hairy \\i{}P. andersonii\\i0{} plants grouped very closely with \\i{}P. langeana\\i0{} specimens (Consaul and Gillespie 2001). An isotype specimen of \\i{}P. andersonii\\i0{} was a mixed collection of \\i{}P. langeana\\i0{} and \\i{}P. andersonii\\i0{}. The close similarity of small \\i{}P. andersonii\\i0{} plants to \\i{}P. langeana\\i0{} is being further studied (Consaul 2002-2006). Consaul (personal communication, March 2005) had compared the ITS sequences from \\i{}P. langeana\\i0{} and \\i{}P. tenella\\i0{}, based on limited herbarium material for the latter, and found these two have the same ITS sequences (different from other diploid species), which lends support to subspecies status. However, she noted that if \\i{}P. langeana\\i0{} and \\i{}P. tenella\\i0{} are subspecies then the question is, What is the name? The appropriateness of placing them under \\i{}P. langeana\\i0{} is addressed in extensive discussion in Sorensen (1953). Tzvelev (1964) provides a counterdiscussion, supporting placing them under \\i{}P. tenella\\i0{} in \\i{}Flora of the Russian Arctic\\i0{} (Vol. 2). After an examination of the protologues and drawings, Consaul et al. (in press) use \\i{}P. tenella\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}langeana\\i0{}, following Tzvelev (1964).\u003e","\u003cSørensen (1953) observed that plants of \\i{}P. vaginata\\i0{} are remarkable for their soft texture, large drooping panicles, which are just exserted above the slightly inflated, uppermost culm leaf sheaths, and by the relatively large, loose, and conspicuously glossy spikelets. \\par{}Grulke and Bliss (1988), in a study of comparative life history characteristics of two High Arctic grasses, noted that \\i{}Puccinellia vaginata\\i0{} occurs in xeric micro-sites with little soil disturbance. Drought stress that reduced whole plant biomass of \\i{}Phippsia\\i0{}, the species that \\i{}P. vaginata\\i0{} was being compared with, affected only seedlings of the latter species. Root biomass remained constant. \\par{}Grulke and Bliss (1988) found that \\i{}P. vaginata\\i0{} was relatively long-lived (living on average 35 years and a maximum of 74 years). They noted that the mean age of initial reproduction was relatively late when compared to temperate species, that is, 26 ± 9 years. Production of viable seeds in \\i{}P. vaginata\\i0{} was restricted by short growing seasons, low solar radiation, and low temperatures. During stressful years, \\i{}P. vaginata\\i0{} usually had low carbon allocation to reproduction, and low rates of mortality. Grulke and Bliss (1988) concluded that \\i{}P. vaginata\\i0{} has most characteristics of a stress-tolerant species. Bell and Bliss (1978) estimated that the roots of \\i{}P. vaginata\\i0{} live 3.4-7 years. \\par{}Consaul and Gillespie (2001) found the species has been more frequently collected in Greenland (from where it was originally described), and in the western continental Northwest Territories and Nunavut, but very few specimens of \\i{}P. vaginata\\i0{} had been collected in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Some of the specimens from the islands have intermediate characteristics, for example, specimens from Baffin Island (CAN 312013 and CAN 295761) are very hairy, and approach \\i{}P. angustata\\i0{} in morphology. A specimen from Melville Island (CAN 502596) and one from Victoria Island (CAN 522664) have smaller trichomes on the glume and lemma margins than are typical for \\i{}P. vaginata\\i0{}, and more approach \\i{}P. bruggemannii\\i0{}. These specimens, as well as a collection from Tanquary Fiord, are indicated on the map. They are included in a current molecular study on species limits of Canadian Arctic \\i{}Puccinellia\\i0{} at the Canadian Museum of Nature.\u003e","\u003cThis taxon was treated as \\i{}Colpodium vahlianum\\i0{} (Liebm.) Nevski, in Porsild (1964). It was placed in the genus \\i{}Puccinellia\\i0{}, subgenus \\i{}Pseudocolpodium\\i0{} (Tzvelev) W.E. Hughes, by Hughes and Halliday (1980). This subgenus differs from subgenus \\i{}Puccinellia\\i0{} in which all our other puccinellias are placed, in that the leaf epidermis is not differentiated into long and short cells, the rachilla is slender and abruptly thickened at the insertion of the florets, and the glumes, with divergent veins, are sub-equal, and almost as long as the lemma. It also differs from the other puccinellias observed in having leaves folded in bud, and bulliform cells on either side of the blade midvein. \\par{}Consaul and Gillespie (2001) found this species to be close morphologically to the rest of the genus, and agreed with including it in the genus \\i{}Puccinellia\\i0{}. The characters that separate plants of this species most clearly from other \\i{}Puccinellia\\i0{} taxa are the very long first glume and the ratio of first glume to spikelet length. This species generally does not have trichomes on the lemma margins, but usually has small (less than 20 microns) and blunt trichomes on the margins of the glumes. The roots of this species are strikingly yellowish, thick and curly. This is a character also found to a certain extent in the arctic polyploid species of the genus, giving more evidence for treating it under the genus \\i{}Puccinellia\\i0{}.\u003e","\u003cBoivin (1967) published ?\\i{}Maltea\\i0{} for what he considered to be the intergeneric hybrid \\i{}Phippsia\\i0{} × \\i{}Puccinellia\\i0{}. As this is not a condensed formula, the name cannot be used for that intergeneric hybrid for which the correct name is ×\\i{}Pucciphippsia\\i0{} Tzvelev (1971). Boivin did, however, provide a Latin description and designate a type; consequently, \\i{}Maltea\\i0{} is a validly published generic name and is correct if its type is treated as belonging to a separate genus, not a nothogenus (Greuter et al. 1994). \\par{}Hedberg (1962) found this hybrid growing at an archeological site, on Cornwallis Island, near the former site of the village at Resolute close to the seashore. His detailed description includes photographs comparing spikelets, leaf cross sections, and chromosome studies. Canadian ×\\i{}Pucciphippsia\\i0{} involves \\i{}Phippsia algida\\i0{} as the \\i{}Phippsia\\i0{} parent, but in Europe, hybrids with \\i{}P. concinna\\i0{} may occur (Hedberg 1962). This may explain slight differences between this description and that given by Halliday and Hughes (1980). A study of ×\\i{}Pucciphippsia\\i0{} in Svalbard indicated that specimens there were triploid and sterile. Additive banding in one enzyme supported its origin as a \\i{}Puccinellia\\i0{} ×\\i{}Phippsia\\i0{} hybrid, and morphological evidence suggested that \\i{}P. algida\\i0{} is the most probable \\i{}Phippsia\\i0{} parent (Steen et al. 2004).\u003e","\u003cHultén (1959b) reported on the \\i{}T. spicatum\\i0{} complex and recognised several varieties, stating that plants in the High Arctic conform closely to subsp. \\i{}spicatum\\i0{} in having dense spike-like inflorescences and a violet colour zone on the glumes and lemmas, while their margins are brown. The culm is strongly pubescent with long, soft, and (except at the top) downward pointing hairs. The panicle branches are pubescent as well as the sheaths, and the awn is affixed at the upper third or fourth of the lemma and bent and twisted. The flowers considerably overtop the glumes. Randall and Hilu (1986) studied \\i{}T. spicatum\\i0{} throughout its North American distribution and concluded that the data for 33 morphological characters revealed extreme variation within the species and did not support the recognition of infraspecific taxa or the elevation of the hexaploids to specific rank. \\par{}Elven et al. (2003) considered this a difficult case where \"the status of the different entities described has varied among authors from species through subspecies, variety, and forma to nothing.\" In addition to the recent work by Randall and Hilu (1986), Syst. Bot. 11: 567-578, we should also consult some previous treatments, e.g., that of Jonsell (1975), Sv. Bot. Tidskr. 69. \"There is a contrast between the homogeneity in the material from [mainland Europe] and the High Arctic and the heterogeneity in that from the Beringian area, western (Cordilleran) North America, northeastern North America, southern Greenland, and Iceland. From a European viewpoint it is difficult to neglect this difference entirely; some taxonomy should be involved\" (Elven et al. 2003). \\par{}Hultén (1959b) reported on the \\i{}T. spicatum\\i0{} complex and recognised [two subspecies and] several varieties [for the Arctic], stating that plants in the High Arctic conform closely to subsp. \\i{}spicatum\\i0{} in having dense spike-like inflorescences and a violet colour zone on the glumes and lemmas, while their margins are brown.

We can see little reason for lumping them within one species, except for the single feature of a narrow capsule with a pyramidal stigmatic disc. However, this feature is also shared with several Asian species. The plants we have seen of \\i{}P. keelei\\i0{} from arctic Canada (incl. Banks Island) closely correspond morphologically to those throughout Alaska and eastern Chukotka.\\par{}Porsild (1945) described \\i{}P. keelei\\i0{} from Yukon, and Hultén (1945) described \\i{}P. macounii\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}discolor\\i0{} from Alaska. Subsequent authors have proposed that the names represent different entities. This assumption was based on publication of two decaploid chromosome counts for \\i{}P. keelei\\i0{} from Yukon (Mulligan and Porsild 1969, Porsild 1975) as different from the numerous tetraploid counts for \\i{}P. macounii\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}discolor \\i0{}[see above]. During field work in Alaska and Yukon in 1998-2003, we saw some variation. We tried to sort this into the two entities that were described, but we were not comfortable with the result. We collected plants conforming morphologically with \\i{}P. keelei\\i0{} as described in northern Yukon (British Mountains 1999, Richardson Mountains 2003) and in north-central Yukon (Ogilvie Mountains 2003), but they were all found to be tetraploid in flow cytometry (Solstad et al., unpublished). According to D.F. Murray (pers. comm.) the Mulligan voucher was originally identified as \\i{}P. radicatum \\i0{}Rottb. This fits well with reported decaploids from several populations of Alaskan and Yukon plants assigned to \\i{}P. \\i0\\lquote\\i{}radicatum\\i0\\rquote{} in the previous North American concept. Murray recollects that the Mulligan voucher was not representative of \\i{}P. keelei\\i0{} stating: \\ldblquote{}So, the 2n\u003d70 reports may be a red herring\\u8213\\\u00273feventually to be ignored.\\rdblquote{} We consider the names\\i{} P. keelei\\i0{} and \\i{}P. macounii\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}discolor\\i0{} as contemporaneous namings of the same taxon of which \\i{}P. keelei\\i0{} is the valid name if accepted as a species.\\par{}The morphologically closest relatives are found in the north Siberian and northeast Asian \\i{}P. paucistaminum \\i0{}Tolm. \u0026 V.V.Petrovsky group (\\i{}P. paucistaminum\\i0{}, \\i{}P. minutiflorum\\i0{} Tolm. and \\i{}P. atrovirens \\i0{}V.V.Petrovsky). Common features include the narrowly clavate capsules with a high conical stigmatic disc, the comparatively few stigmatic rays, and partly also the diffuse growth and preference for damp and densely vegetated grassy or mossy habitats. Main differences between \\i{}P. keelei\\i0{} and the \\i{}P. paucistaminum\\i0{} group are the lower ploidal level and the more numerous stamens of \\i{}P. keelei\\i0{}. Analyses of AFLP fragments also confirm a genetic connection between \\i{}P. atrovirens\\i0{} and \\i{}P. paucistamineum\\i0{} although the results are not that clear-cut probably due to polyploidisation and reticulation events (Solstad et al., unpublished results).\u003e","\u003cThe taxonomy of \\i{}Papaver\\i0{} section \\i{}Meconella\\i0{} Spach is controversial both in the Arctic and in temperate and boreal regions. In the last 60-70 years several approaches have been taken for arctic Canadian species. Polunin (1940, p.223) accepted a broad \\i{}P. radicatum\\i0{} Rottb. in the eastern Canadian Arctic with the following justification: \\ldblquote{}Whether or not the recent wholesale \\lquote{}splitting\\rquote{} of the Old World members of this group (cf. Nordhagen 1931) is justified I am quite unqualified to say, but certainly the material from within our area, variable as it is, seems to belong to one series that should be kept together under a single specific name\\rdblquote{}. Fifteen years later Porsild (1955) followed the same policy for the poppies of the western Canadian Arctic, except that he accepted the Banks Island \\i{}P. keelei\\i0{} A.E.Porsild as a separate species. He commented, however, that: \\ldblquote{}On the basis of such combination of characters, it may be possible to recognize within the Canadian Arctic Archipelago four \\lquote{}races\\rquote{} of \\i{}P. radicatum\\i0{}, each with a rather distinct geographical range\\rdblquote{} (p. 118) without further elaboration.\\par{}\\tab{}Morphological, cytological and hybridization studies by Knaben (1959a, 1959b) resulted in her recognizing four non-intergrading species in the amphi-Atlantic region: a decaploid \\i{}P. radicatum\\i0{} s. str. which she considered as strictly European (Iceland, the Faeroes, and Scandinavia), a decaploid \\i{}P. dahlianum\\i0{} Nordh. as mainly high arctic in Greenland and arctic Europe, an octoploid \\i{}P. laestadianum \\i0{}(Nordh.) Nordh. as a local endemic in N Scandinavia, and an octoploid \\i{}P. lapponicum\\i0{} (Tolm.) Nordh. to which she assigned plants from N Russia, N Scandinavia, and all plants in Greenland and arctic Canada except for \\i{}P. dahlianum\\i0{}. She also recognized three New World subspecies of \\i{}P. lapponicum\\i0{}: subsp. \\i{}occidentale\\i0{} (A.E.Lundstr.) G.Knaben, subsp. \\i{}porsildii\\i0{} G.Knaben, and subsp. \\i{}labradoricum\\i0{} (Fedde) G.Knaben - all present in both Greenland and arctic Canada, and a Scandinavian subsp. \\i{}scandinavicum\\i0{} G.Knaben. Her treatment was supported by morphological features and partly by much lower fertility in crosses between races and species than within.\\par{}\\tab{}Confusion was caused by an ambiguous typification of the name \\i{}P. radicatum.\\i0{} Knaben (1958) proposed a typification based on Icelandic plants, further argued for by Knaben \u0026 Hylander (1970). Löve (1955) proposed a typification based on Greenlandic plants (i.e., Knaben\\rquote{}s \\i{}P. lapponicum\\i0{}), based on a suggestion by Hultén (1945) and further argued by Löve (1962a, 1962b). In Löve\\rquote{}s proposal, the Icelandic and Scandinavian plants are not \\i{}P. radicatum\\i0{}. The issue is now solved by (hopefully) final typifications of \\i{}P. radicatum\\i0{} on Icelandic material (Nilsson \u0026 Elven in Jonsell 2001) and also of \\i{}P. lapponicum\\i0{} on NW Russian material (Egorova 1998). Whereas Knaben\\rquote{}s conclusions were accepted and applied in Europe, this was not the case in North America or Greenland. Böcher et al. (1978, p. 102) applied a broadly circumscribed \\i{}P. \\lquote{}radicatum\\rquote{} \\i0{}in Greenland but suggested three \\lquote{}smaller\\rquote{} species (\\lquote{}småarter\\rquote{} in Danish): one \\i{}P.\\i0{} sp. perhaps related to \\i{}P. dahlianum\\i0{}, another \\i{}P.\\i0{} sp. perhaps conspecific with \\i{}P. cornwallisense\\i0{} D.Löve (described from Cornwallis Island), and a \\i{}P. \\lquote{}radicatum\\rquote\\i0{} s. str. which they considered synonymous with \\i{}P. lapponicum\\i0{} sensu Knaben and with three subspecies: subsp. \\i\\lquote{}radicatum\\rquote\\i0{} (same as Knaben\\rquote{}s \\i{}P. lapponicum\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}occidentale\\i0{}), subsp. \\i{}labradoricum\\i0{} and subsp. \\i{}porsildii\\i0{}. Böcher then closely followed Knaben except with the opposite meaning for the name \\i{}P. radicatum\\i0{}. The same was done by Porsild \u0026 Cody (1980) in that they accepted three species in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago: \\i{}P. keelei\\i0{} on Banks Island; \\i{}P. cornwallisense\\i0{} on most of the islands (and in N Greenland) but rare or absent on most of Baffin Island; and \\i{}P. radicatum\\i0{} (meaning \\i{}P. lapponicum\\i0{} as now typified) throughout. Major parts of the treatments of Böcher et al. (1978) and Porsild \u0026 Cody (1980) are reflected in the molecular data we now have available.\\par{}\\tab{}A major effort to clarify the taxonomy was made by Kiger \u0026 Murray (1997, for arctic poppies mainly by Murray) in Flora of North America. Besides \\i{}P. keelei\\i0{} (by them as \\i{}P. macounii\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}discolor\\i0{} (Hultén) Rändel ex D.F.Murray), they accepted three taxa in the islands: \\i{}P. lapponicum\\i0{}, \\i{}P. radicatum\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}radicatum\\i0{}, and \\i{}P. radicatum\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}polare\\i0{}. In their synonymy, Knaben\\rquote{}s three Greenlandic and Canadian races of \\i{}P. lapponicum\\i0{} were included in \\i{}P. radicatum\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}radicatum\\i0{}, \\i{}P. cornwallisense\\i0{} was included in \\i{}P. radicatum\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}polare\\i0{} (which they, on the authority of Rändel 1974, considered as specifically different from \\i{}P. dahlianum\\i0{}), whereas their \\i{}P. lapponicum\\i0{} was based on the Russian description and included \\i{}P. hultenii\\i0{} Knaben as a synonym. Their treatment must have been based on an assumption that Knaben\\rquote{}s Greenlandic-Canadian races of \\i{}P. lapponicum\\i0{} (their \\i{}P. \\lquote{}radicatum\\rquote\\i0{}) are specifically different from the N European \\i{}P. lapponicum\\i0{} (their \\i{}P. lapponicum\\i0{}). Many of the problems connected with the North American treatments are due to the persistent attempt in American tradition to apply European names to their poppies. \\par{}\\tab{}Our morphological and molecular (mainly AFLPs \\u8213\\\u00273f Amplified fragment length polymorphisms, a fingerprinting method) data are not in accordance with the Flora of North America treatment; they instead extend the taxonomy suggested by Böcher et al. (1978) and Porsild \u0026 Cody (1980), but with other names. There appear to be five separate entities (in addition \\i{}P. keelei\\i0{}), likely best recognized at the specific level, in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. The main features of our provisional revised taxonomy are:\\par{}\\tab\\par{}(1) \\i{}Papaver dahlianum\\i0{} (typified from mainland N Norway) and \\i{}P. polare\\i0{} (Tolm.) Perfil., (\\i{}P. radicatum\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}polare\\i0{}, \\i{}P. dahlianum\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}polare \\i0{}(Tolm.) Elven \u0026 Ö.Nilsson, typified from the Svalbard islands) are conspecific and not separable by molecular markers. They are also similar in morphology. \\i{}Papaver dahlianum\\i0{} (subsp. \\i{}polare\\i0{}) is widespread in northern and western parts of the islands but rare in central, southern and eastern parts. Our range conforms closely with that made by Petrovsky (1999) from morphological evidence alone. \\i{}Papaver dahlianum\\i0{} is morphologically close to \\i{}P. cornwallisense\\i0{} but separable on, leaf and leaf lobe shape (ovate in \\i{}P. dahlianum\\i0{} versus narrow, strap-shaped in \\i{}P. cornwallisense\\i0{}), leaf color (greyish green versus dark to bluish green), and in capsule shape (more or less elongated pear-shaped versus subglobular). Molecular markers place \\i{}Papaver dahlianum\\i0{} much closer to \\i{}P. uschakovii\\i0{} Tolm. \u0026 V.V.Petrovsky from Wrangel Island and to a yet unnamed N Alaskan entity than to \\i{}P. cornwallisense\\i0{}. Both \\i{}Papaver dahlianum\\i0{} and \\i{}P. cornwallisense\\i0{} are widespread in the Canadian Arctic, with overlapping ranges, but no clear intergradation has been observed in molecular markers. They are probably allopolyploids based on different parental combinations.\\par{}\\par{}(2) \\i{}Papaver cornwallisense\\i0{} is widespread (see above) but especially concentrated in the central, southern and eastern parts of the islands. This supports the proposal of Böcher et al. (1978). The \\i{}P. cornwallisense\\i0{} of Porsild \u0026 Cody (1980), however, includes both \\i{}P. cornwallisense \\i0{}and\\i{} P. dahlianum\\i0{}. The affinity of \\i{}P. cornwallisense\\i0{} judged by molecular markers is clearly to \\i{}P. gorodkovii\\i0{} in Beringia (also morphologically in leaf color, in leaf lobe and capsule shape, and in often smaller flowers). Our molecular results also conform very well with the map of \\i{}P. cornwallisense \\i0{}by Petrovsky (1999).\\par{}\\par{}(3) \\i{}Papaver lapponicum\\i0{} is polymorphic both in molecular markers and in morphology, but belongs to the same major group as \\i{}P\\i0{}. \\i{}radicatum\\i0{} (see next paragraph). Material from the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (except for most of Baffin Island) and from northern parts of Greenland constitute one subunit, corresponding with Knaben\\rquote{}s subsp. \\i{}occidentale\\i0{} and also subsp. \\i{}porsildii\\i0{}. Material from NE Greenland, N Scandinavia and N Ural mountains belong in another subunit, corresponding with subsp. \\i{}lapponicum\\i0{} and including subsp. \\i{}jugoricum \\i0{}(Tolm.) Tolm. of the Ural Mountains. Material from Taimyr in N Siberia forms the third subunit and corresponds with subsp. \\i{}orientale \\i0{}Tolm. Much of the material we now assign to \\i{}P. lapponicum\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}occidentale\\i0{} was field identified as \\i{}P. dahlianum\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}polare\\i0{} because subsp. \\i{}occidentale\\i0{} superficially resembles \\i{}P. dahlianum\\i0{} morphologically (and even the original illustration of Lundström and his type specimen does). Molecular markers do not show close connections between \\i{}P. dahlianum \\i0{}and \\i{}P. lapponicum\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}occidentale\\i0{}.\\par{}\\i{}Papaver radicatum\\i0{} (as typified) is, in our material, restricted to Iceland and Scandinavia. Its closest relatives are found to the east, in N Russia and NW Siberia. None of our numerous samples from all major parts of Greenland and the Canadian Arctic Archipelago confirm the occurrence of \\i{}P. radicatum \\i0{}in these areas. This supports the conclusions of Knaben (1959a, 1959b) and also those of Böcher et al. (1978) and Porsild \u0026 Cody (1980), but under different names.\\par{}\\par{}(4) Material from the easternmost parts of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and W Greenland differ from all the other groups in molecular markers and are also distinct in morphological features. These plants were recognized early as a race \\i\\lquote{}labradoricum\\rquote\\i0{} and treated by Knaben as \\i{}P. lapponicum\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}labradoricum\\i0{}. The molecular data indicate that \\i{}Papaver \\lquote{}labradoricum\\rquote\\i0{} is a distinct entity and does not belong to the \\i{}P. radicatum\\i0{}-\\i{}lapponicum\\i0{} complex (nor to the \\i{}P. dahlianum\\i0{}-\\i{}cornwallisense\\i0{} complex). It should therefore be separated from \\i{}P. lapponicum\\i0{} at the specific level and recognized as \\i{}P. \\lquote{}labradoricum\\rquote{}.\\i0{} At present \\i{}P. \\lquote{}labradoricum\\rquote\\i0{} is known from SW and W Greenland, Baffin Island, N Labrador and N Quebec, and in most of these regions it seems to be the only species of \\i{}Papaver\\i0{}. \\i{}Papaver \\lquote{}labradoricum\\rquote\\i0{} resembles European \\i{}P. radicatum\\i0{} in some features (numerous and erect stems, comparatively small and not fully open flowers, capsule shape) but differs in leaf shape (lobes always narrowly ovate-lanceolate, simple and mostly diverging at a small angle from the mid axis). Molecular markes indicate that the Asian Beringian \\i{}P. detritophilum \\i0{}is the closest relative.\\par{}\\par{}(5) Plants from several sites on Banks Island were assigned to a separate and quite distinct molecular group that connects to several still taxonomically unresolved taxa in western and Beringian North America (including the Cordilleran \\i{}P. kluanense\\i0{}) and also in Beringian Asia, especially in Wrangel Island, but is distinctly different also from these. The Banks Island plants most probably represent an undescribed species.\\par{}\\b\\par{}Provisional key to \\i{}Papaver\\i0{} spp. (not including \\i{}P. keelei\\i0{})\\par{}\\b0\\par{}1.

On continental North America when this anemone is in full bloom, it is much taller and more flexible than the cloudberry.\u003e","\u003cDutton et al. (1997), in the \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{}, treated this taxon as \\i{}Anemone patens \\i0{}var.\\i{} multifida\\i0{}. They were aware that this taxon is often placed in the genus \\i{}Pulsatilla\\i0{} Miller on the basis of the long plumose achene beaks but claimed that recent phylogentic analyses of \\i{}Anemone\\i0{} in the broad sense indicated that it should be subsumed within \\i{}Anemone\\i0{} (Hoot et al. 1994). They commented that \\i{}Anemone patens\\i0{} var.\\i{} multifida\\i0{} has frequently been recognised as a subspecies of \\i{}A. patens\\i0{}. A close relative of this taxon \\i{}Anemone patens\\i0{} var.\\i{} wolfgangiana\\i0{} is the floral emblem of Manitoba and the State Flower of North Dakota. \\par{}Elven et al. (2003) treated this taxon as \\i{}Pulsatilla patens\\i0{} (L.) Mill. subsp. \\i{}multifida\\i0{} (Pritz.) Zämelis. \\par{}Hultén (1944, p. 739) commented, \"I can see no essential difference between the Siberian plant and the American and must consequently refer both to the same subspecies [i.e., subsp. \\i{}multifida\\i0{}]. I find it impossible to regard the different races of \\i{}Anemone patens\\i0{} as distinct species as Juzupczuk does in Fl. S.S.S.R. Where they meet, intermediate forms occur and they are clearly geographic races\". This concept has been followed in Elven et al. (2003). \\par{}Petrovsky, in Tolmatchew (1971a), discussed the relations among the Asian and North American plants but not their relation to the European - western Siberian \\i{}P. patens\\i0{}. Other authors, like Zämelis (1926), Hultén and Fries (1986), and Lindell, in Jonsell (2001a), have considered these entities as widely distributed geographical races (i.e., subspecies) of one wide species for which \\i{}P. patens\\i0{} is the oldest name. That approach was followed by Elven et al. (2003). \\par{}This taxon and its related varieties show considerable variation, which is considered to be environmentally induced. \\par{}Two varieties were recognised by Dutton et al. (1997) in northwestern North America, both within the Arctic. Variety \\i{}multifida\\i0{} was mapped for arctic parts of northeastern Alaska, northern Yukon, the Hudson Bay area in Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec, and northernmost Ungava Peninsula. Variety \\i{}saxicola\\i0{} occurs in the western Cordilleran and reaches the arctic in northern Alaska. Several assumed independently inherited differential characters are given. However, in general, var. \\i{}saxicola\\i0{} occurs almost entirely within the range of var. \\i{}multifida\\i0{}. Elven et al. (2003) compared Alaskan material annotated, as the two varieties found no very clear differences, and proposed that the varieties be treated as synonyms.\u003e","\u003cThis showy anemone is named for John Richardson who was the surgeon-naturalist with the Franklin expedition of 1819-1822. This is the only northern anemone with yellow flowers. Richardson\u0027s anemone can be found in bloom until late in the season by searching in areas where snow banks persist. It also grows in moist, sheltered areas under willows, usually on continental North America (Burt 2000).\u003e","\u003c\"Caltha\" was applied by Vergil (before 19 B.C.) for a yellow-flowered plant, probably with reference to \\i{}Calendula \\i0{}(Elven, personal communication, 2005). Burt (2000) suggested \\ldblquote{}Caltha\\rdblquote{} means cup and refers to the shape of the flowers. This plant occurs all over the northern hemisphere, and got its name in the Middle Ages when it was called \\ldblquote{}the flower of the Virgin Mary\\rdblquote{}, or \\ldblquote{}Mary\\rquote{}s gold\\rdblquote{}, and \\ldblquote{}marybuds\\rdblquote{}. In various parts of the world, marsh marigold is known as an edible herb, though it is toxic when eaten raw. It must be dried or boiled in two changes of water in order to remove the poisonous glycoside \\lquote{}protpanemonin\\rquote{} (Schofield 1989). Eating is not recommended, and it is not used by any of the people of the north, according to Burt (2000). \\par{}Ford (1997, pp. 188-189) noted that \\i{}C. palustris \\i0\\ldblquote{}has been divided into different taxa, although plants have been most commonly assigned to two varieties in North America. Typical \\i{}C. palustris\\i0{} var.\\i{} palustris\\i0{} is characterised by permanently erect, stout stems that do not produce roots and shoots at the nodes after anthesis. The basal leaves are broadly cordate to reniform with coarsely crenate-dentate margins and overlapping basal lobes. Generally more than three flowers occur on the stem. In contrast, \\i{}C. palustris\\i0{} var. \\i{}flabellata\\i0{} [\u003d var. \\i{}arctica\\i0{}, var. \\i{}radicans\\i0{} (T.F. Forester) Beck] is characterised by stems that sprawl with age and produce roots and shoots at the nodes after anthesis. The basal leaves are more or less reniform with denticulate margins and the basal lobes are widely divergent and do not overlap. Often fewer than three flowers occur on the stem. \\i{}Caltha palustris\\i0{} var. \\i{}flabellata \\i0{}is distributed locally throughout the range of \\i{}C. palustris\\i0{} var. \\i{}palustris; \\i0{}it often grows in places with more extreme environmental conditions, such as shorelines, tidal areas, swiftly running streams and rivers, and area with an arctic climate. While \\i{}Caltha palustris\\i0{} var. \\i{}palustris \\i0{}and var. \\i{}flabellifolia\\i0{} are distinctive in their extremes they appear to represent elements along a morphologic continuum rather than recognizable taxonomic entities. For example, Smit (1973) found plants from Point Barrow Alaska to be dwarfed, few flowered, and prostrate, while specimens from southern Alaska were robust, many-flowered, and erect. Between these two extremes a complete series of intermediates occurs. Based on that evidence, and considering the phenotypic plasticity known to exist in this species, the infraspecific segregates were not recognised.\\rdblquote{} \\par{}Jalas and Suominen (1989) noted that continued biosytematic studies have supported the view put forward in \\i{}Flora Europaea\\i0{} that division of \\i{}Caltha palustris\\i0{} s.l. at specific or subspecific level is not justified, since the widely used follicle characters \\ldblquote{}vary independently of other morphological characters and of chromosome number\\rdblquote{}. \\par{}Schuettpelz et al. (2004) presented a phylogeny and biogeography of \\i{}Caltha\\i0{} based on chloroplast and nuclear DNA sequences but mainly for southern hemisphere species.\u003e","\u003cFord (1997, p. 245) noted that \\ldblquote{}Fernald (1929) treated plants from Greenland and eastern North America as \\i{}C. groenlandica\\i0{} and those from Alaska and eastern Asia as \\i{}C. trifolia\\i0{}. He did concede that intermediates occur. Hultén (1937a) treated the two taxa as subspecies but concluded that \\i{}C. trifolia\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}trifolia\\i0{} was restricted to the Aleutian Islands in North America\\u8230\\\u002785 Hultén (1944) later revised this decision, concluding that the differences between the two subspecies were too slight to warrant their continued recognition. Finally, R.L. Taylor and G.A. Mulligan (1968), in their study of North American \\i{}Coptis\\i0{}, found that the two subspecies could be distinguished on the basis of sepals and seed shape; subsp. \\i{}trifolia\\i0{}, having clawed petals and quadrate seeds; subsp. \\i{}groenlandica\\i0{}, possessing sepals that gradually narrow towards the base and round seeds. Petiolule length, sepal width, and the length-to-width ratio of the nectary, follicle body and beak length, and sepal and seed shape have been used most commonly to distingush these two taxa.\\rdblquote{} Ford (1997) compared herbarium specimens from the Aleutian Islands and the rest of North America and eastern Asia and concluded that no distinction could be made.\u003e","","\u003cEricsson, in Jonsell (2001a, \\i{}Flora Nordica\\i0{} 2), noted that \\i{}Ranunculus affinis\\i0{} R. Br. was first described validly in Chloris Melvilliana (published late in 1823). Richardson\u0027s \\i{}R. arcticus\\i0{}, in \u0027Bot. App.\u0027 (from March 1823), predates Brown\u0027s \\i{}R. affinis\\i0{}. \\par{}Elven et al. (2003) noted that \"Löve and Löve (1975) listed five hexaploid counts for their \\i{}R. affinis\\i0{} s.s., mostly as arctic. However, they listed numerous tetraploid counts under the name \\i{}R. wilanderi\\i0{}, all from areas where this local Svalbard endemic of the \\i{}R. auricomus\\i0{} aggregate (Ericsson, in Jonsell 2001a, \\i{}Flora Nordica\\i0{} 2) is unknown. It is therefore quite evident that they have \u0027sorted\u0027 their chromosome counts entirely independent of the morphology (and taxonomy), and that \\i{}R. arcticus\\i0{} occurs with at least two ploidy levels, tetraploid and hexaploid.\" \\par{}The reproductive system of \\i{}R. arcticus\\i0{} is not known, but agamospermy, as in the related \\i{}R. auricomus\\i0{} aggregate, cannot be excluded (Böcher and Larsen 1950) [Meddel. Grønl. 147, 6]. Rozanova (1932) [Trudy Peterg. Estestv.-Nauchn. Inst. 8: 19-148], however, found the pollen to be good and found no fruit set after emasculation and pollination with pollen from \\i{}R. auricomus\\i0{}. It is still difficult to separate plants of the \\i{}R. arcticus\\i0{} and \\i{}R. auricomus\\i0{} groups in some areas, especially in northern Russia. Even if some local populations and population groups might be separable on morphological criteria (and could receive names), there is no current circumpolar survey of the variation. \\par{}Whittemore (1997) treated this taxon under the name the name \\i{}Ranunculus pedatifidus\\i0{} var. \\i{}affinis\\i0{}. He noted that specimens of \\i{}Ranunculus pedatifidus\\i0{} from southern Siberia, China, and central Asia, including the type specimen, are relatively small and slender, with all the main divisions of the leaf parted into narrow (1.5-2.5 mm wide) segments. American material, including the type of \\i{}R. affinis\\i0{}, is more robust; the main divisions of the leaf are mostly undivided, and the ultimate segments are broader (2-4 mm wide). Benson (1954) referred all material from Asia and the islands in the Bering Sea to var. \\i{}pedatifidus\\i0{}. Whittemore indicated other authors who have limited typical \\i{}pedatifidus\\i0{} to material from temperate Asia and suggested that further comparisons of American and Eurasian material are needed. \\par{}Glabrous-fruited forms, first described from Asia, have been called\\i{} Ranunculus pedatifidus\\i0{} var. \\i{}leiocarpus\\i0{} (Tra\\u363\\\u00273fv.) Fernald.\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Ranunculus aquatilis\\i0{} var. \\i{}diffusus\\i0{} belongs to the subgenus \\i{}Batrachium\\i0{} (DC) A. Gray (\\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{}, Whittemore 1997). There has also been evidence presented to raise it to genus \\i{}Batrachium\\i0{} Gray (Elven et al. 2005). Although recognition of \\i{}Batrachium\\i0{} as a genus separate from \\i{}Ranunculus\\i0{} is not in accordance with the work of Johansson (1998), [Pl. Syst. Evol. 213: 253-261] based on cpDNA restriction analysis, Elven et al. (2003) proposed keeping the name \\i{}Batrachium\\i0{} in a northern context because it is a fairly distinct segregate. We follow the former treatment here. \\i\\par{}Ranunculus aquatilis\\i0{} shows many variants based on achene beak length and pubescence of the receptacle, which intergrade with each other so only two varieties are recognised in North America (Whittemore 1997). This variety has all of its leaves filiform-dissected while var. \\i{}aquatilis\\i0{} has laminate and filiform-dissected leaves. \\par{}Whittemore divided \\i{}R. aquatilis\\i0{} into two subspecies, and his \\i{}R. aquatilis\\i0{} var. \\i{}diffusus\\i0{} was quite inclusive. He commented \"\\i{}Ranunculus aquatilis\\i0{} var. \\i{}diffusus\\i0{} shows geographical variation, and some regional forms have been recognised as varieties. Dwarf creeping arctic plants m ay be called \\i{}R. aquatilis\\i0{} var. \\i{}eradicatum\\i0{}, plants with linear non-capillary leaf segments from the northern Great Basin may be called \\i{}R. aquatilis\\i0{} var. \\i{}porteri,\\i0{} and very robust plants from Oregon and northern most California may be called \\i{}R. aquatilis\\i0{} var. \\i{}harrisii\\i0{}. Extreme forms of these races are recognizable, but they intergrade and many specimens cannot be confidently assigned to one or another of them\" (Whittemore 1997, p 132). \\par{}Elven et al. (2005) split off some of the entities included here into \\i{}Batrachium eradicatum\\i0{}, which encompass the synonym epithets \"\\i{}eradicatus\\i0{},\" \\i{}lutulentus\\i0{}\" \"\\i{}subrigidus\\i0{},\" and \"\\i{}confervoides\\i0{}.\" \\par{}\\i{}Ranunculus aquatilis\\i0{} var. \\i{}diffusus\\i0{} is self-compatible, largely cleistogamous, with flowers pollinated in the submerged state; the fruit setting is very rich.\\par{}Brayshaw (1989) noted that the variation in leaf form in this and related species, is of a kind that has given rise to endless confusion regarding the identities and limits of species and varieties; a large number of species had varieties have been described based on the diversity of form, accounting for some of the difficulties in coming to an agreement about the taxonomic treatment of this group.\u003e","\u003cIn the north, this species becomes reduced in size, with the leaf blade 3-toothed and flowers solitary. Transplant experiments have shown that this is environmentally induced (Scott 1976, Porsild and Cody 1980).\u003e","\u003cThe mainly Eurasian \\i{}R. gmelinii\\i0{} and the American \\i{}R. purshii\\i0{} may be seen either as parapatric subspecies or as vicariant species (based on possibly different ploidy levels). Elven et al. (2003) proposed them as subspecies. A third taxon of the group, the tetraploid \\i{}R. limosus\\i0{} Nutt., was given as arctic by Löve and Löve (1975), but this has not been accepted by other standard sources. Elven et al. (2003) included the name in subsp. \\i{}gmelinii\\i0{}. Scoggan (1978) treated it as a variety, together with var. \\i{}hookeri\\i0{} (D. Don) L.D. Benson (\u003d subsp. \\i{}purshii\\i0{}) and var. \\i{}gmelinii\\i0{}. The characters used to distinguish \\i{}R. limosus\\i0{} are such that might be associated with the reported hybridisation between \\i{}R. gmelinii\\i0{} and \\i{}R. hyperboreus\\i0{}; see Cayouette et al. Rhodora 99: 263-274. 1997. \\par{}Whittemore (1997) noted that this taxon has been divided into varieties on the basis of indument and flower size. These characters are variable and poorly correlated with one another. These varieties scarcely seem natural.\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Ranunculus hyperboreus\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}hyperboreus\\i0{} occurs in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. This and a second subspecies, \\i{}Ranunculus hyperboreus\\i0{} Rottb. subsp. \\i{}arnellii\\i0{} Scheutz, represent comparatively clear parapatric entities, that is, subspecies (\\i{}\u0027hyperboreus\u0027\\i0{} and \\i{}\u0027arnellii\u0027\\i0{}) with intermediates, e.g., in coastal northern Norway. \\par{}Whittemore (1997) noted that specimens from the central and southern Rocky Mountains that have the leaves always cordate and the fruiting heads always 4-5 mm have been distinguished as \\i{}R. hyperboreus\\i0{} subsp.\\i{} intertextus.\\i0{} Although Arctic specimens are more variable, they often have shallowly cordate leaf bases and equally large heads of achenes, so segregation of the subspecies seems inappropriate.\\par{}\u003e","\u003cWhittemore (1997), in the \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{}, treated this taxon as \\i{}Ranunculus lapponicus\\i0{} L. and placed this species as the only one in North America in subg. \\i{}Coptidium\\i0{} (Nyman) L.D. Benson. He was aware that considerable disagreement exists among authors on the proper generic and infrageneric classification of \\i{}Ranunculus\\i0{} and chose to follow the generic and infrageneric treatment of Benson (1948). \\par{}Elven et al. (2003, 2005) treated this taxon as \\i{}Coptidium lapponicum\\i0{} (L.) Tzvelev, but stated they would prefer having additional characters before maintaining this taxon at the generic level. In this subgenus or genus, the glabrous nectary scale is attached on 3 sides, forming a pocket, with the free margin entire. The flowers are sweetly scented, which is characteristic of genus \\i{}Coptidum\\i0{} and not of genus \\i{}Ranunculus\\i0{}.\u003e","","\u003cTreated as \\i{}Coptidium pallasii\\i0{} (Schltdl.) Tzvelev by Elven et al. (2003, 2005). In this subgenus (\\i{}Palliasiantha\\i0{}) the glabrous nectary scale is attached on 3 sides for at least half its length, forming a pocket (sometimes the mouth of the pocket prolonged as a short flap), the free margin entire (Whittemore 1997).\u003e","\u003cWhittemore (1997) noted that \\i{}R. pygmaeus\\i0{} var.\\i{} langeana\\i0{} has been described as having deeply divided basal leaves and strongly elongate heads of achenes (at least 5 mm long). These characteristics are not well correlated with one another, however, and the variety does not seem natural.\u003e","\u003cHultén (1971) considered this taxon to be a hybrid of \\i{}R. nivalis\\i0{} × \\i{}R. pygmaeus\\i0{}. Elven et al. (2003, 2005) consider it is a good species which occurs within the range of \\i{}R. pygmaeus\\i0{} and sometimes in company with it, but it is well separated morphologically, with different chromosome ploidy, and partly also ecologically.\u003e","\u003cIn the protologue (1936), Drew noted that the typical form of this species is superficially similar to the European \\i{}R. circinatus\\i0{} with which it has long been confused. However, the petals are larger than those of the European plant, and consequently, there are a greater number of veins that are usually more forked towards the distal end of the petal. The leaves of subrigidus are only \\ldblquote{}subrigid\\rdblquote{} and rather flaccid, whereas those of European \\i{}R. circinatus\\i0{} are usually very rigid and stiff. Immature carpels of \\i{}R. subrigidus\\i0{} have long styles, which do not usually persist to any marked extent at maturity. Drew provided illustrations of the leaves, receptacle hairs, and achenes.\u003e","\u003cThe name \\i{}R. altaicus\\i0{} has sometimes been applied for the arctic plants. However, true \\i{}R. altaicus\\i0{} seems to be a diploid (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 16, Krasnikov and Schaulo 1986, Siberia).\u003e","\u003cVarious attempts have been made to subdivide this variable species, but the taxa proposed have proved difficult to define morphologically. \\par{}Ritchie (1977) considered \\i{}Plantago canescens\\i0{} and \\i{}Selaginella sibirica\\i0{} to be among megaberingian floristic elements that reached an area near Inuvik, N.W.T., early in the course of plant migration. He studied the Campbell-Dolomite uplands, a small area (140 km\\super{}2\\nosupersub{}) of outcropping, faulted dolomite, limestone, and shale east of the Mackenzie River Delta, approximately 40 km south of the northern limit of trees. The patterns of change in pollen spectra suggest an initial phase of migration of willow and herbs from adjacent unglaciated Megaberingia (North Yukon and Alaska), followed rapidly by dwarf birch and later poplar. Megaberingian floristic elements, for example, \\i{}Plantago canescens\\i0{} and \\i{}Selaginella sibirica\\i0{}, reached the area during this early phase of migration.\u003e","\u003cThe \\i{}\u0027juncoides\u0027\\i0{} names are questioned, as the name relates to a plant from South America, and the correspondence between South American and northern plants has not been sufficiently documented (Elven et al. 2003).\u003e","","\u003cThis taxon is related to, but considered species-level distinct from, the amphi-Beringian, \\i{}A. longipedunculata \\i0{}Hultén, which is reported as octoploid (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 80, Löve and Löve, in Löve 1975a) and reaches east to the Mackenzie River and western N.W.T. on continental North America. \\par{}McNeill (1962) [Notes Roy. Bot. Gard. Edinb. 24: 112] cited the author combination as \u0027(Sw.) Wahlenb.\u0027. However, there is no reference to Schwarz in Wahlenberg\u0027s publication (Elven, in discussion, 2002).\u003e","\u003cThree subspecies of \\i{}C. alpinum\\i0{} are recognised from European parts of the North Atlantic area: subsp. \\i{}alpinum\\i0{}, subsp. \\i{}lanatum\\i0{} (Lam.) Graebn. and Correns, and subsp. \\i{}glabratum\\i0{} (Hartman) Á. and D. Löve. This subdivision is mainly based on differences in pubescence, although other distinguishing characters (growth form and leaf shape) as well as different ecological preferences also have been indicated. Densely lanate plants are included in subsp. \\i{}lanatum\\i0{}, whereas glabrous or nearly glabrous plants are included in subsp. \\i{}glabratum\\i0{}. In some treatments, glabrous plants have been given specific rank as \\i{}C. glabratum\\i0{} Hartman (e.g., Hultén 1955, 1956, Jalas et al. 1993). Densely lanate forms were originally described as a separate species, \\i{}C. lanatum\\i0{}, by Lamarck (1785). Recent studies based on hybridisation experiments, analyses of habitat choice, morphometric, and isoenzyme analyses support the prevailing Nordic view of three subspecific taxa of equal rank (Grundt et al. 1999, Brysting and Borgen 2000). \\par{}\\i{}Cerastium alpinum\\i0{} from Greenland and other Arctic areas has been referred to subsp. \\i{}lanatum\\i0{} by several authors (e.g., Hultén 1956). This subspecies was, however, described from central Europe and has a relatively thermophilous, montane to low alpine distribution in central Europe and Fennoscandia. The arctic representatives differ from the central and northern European subsp. \\i{}lanatum\\i0{} in several morphological characters (they are generally coarser, have long, narrow, and more acute leaves, larger flowers and fruits, and a coarser indumentum). The lanate plants of Arctic areas have probably evolved independently of the thermophilous plant of central and northern Europe, and the subspecific name should be avoided for arctic populations (Elven and Elvebakk 1996). The arctic (Greenland, North American) plants may merit rank as a fourth and yet unnamed subspecies (Elven et al. 2003). \\par{}Even though much variation in hairiness is found in North American plants of \\i{}C. alpinum\\i0{}, there seems to be little support for a split into clearly definable geographical races or subspecies within the North American area at this time.\u003e","\u003cThere are two \u0027competing\u0027 circumpolar treatments of the taxa within the polymorphic \\i{}C. alpinum\\i0{} - \\i{}C. arcticum\\i0{} complex. Hultén (1956) emphasised fairly recent hybridisation and introgression, whereas Böcher (1977) postulated a mature polyploid complex. Owing to the differing treatments and an assumed lack of diagnostic characters, many recent authors treating the Greenland and American plants have lumped all into an extremely widely defined \\i{}C. alpinum\\i0{}. \\par{}Recent studies of the complex in the North Atlantic area confirm that the tetraploid (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 72) \\i{}C. alpinum\\i0{} and the hexaploid (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 108) \\i{}C. arcticum\\i0{} s.l. are closely related and that \\i{}C. alpinum\\i0{} may be responsible for most of the genes in \\i{}C. arcticum\\i0{} s.l. The latter is, however, morphologically and genetically heterogenous with a southern entity in Fennoscandia, the British Isles, Iceland, and possibly southwestern Greenland, and a northern entity in arctic European Russia, Svalbard, most of Greenland, and northeastern North America. According to Brysting and Elven (2000), these two entities should be recognised as two separate species: the name \\i{}C. nigrescens\\i0{} (H.C. Watson) Edmondston, applied to the southern taxon (typified from Shetland); and \\i{}C. arcticum\\i0{} s.s., to the northern taxon (typified from western Greenland). There are still some unresolved questions concerning southwestern Greenland material, which includes intermediate populations at a higher ploidy level (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d about 132; Brysting 2000). \\par{}Both Hultén (1956) and Böcher (1977) proposed several new infraspecific taxa within \\i{}C. arcticum\\i0{}. Hultén divided the arctic representatives into three varieties: var. \\i{}procerum\\i0{} (Lange) Hultén, var. \\i{}vestitum\\i0{} Hultén, and var. \\i{}sordidum\\i0{} Hultén, whereas Böcher treated the variation he observed in arctic plants at the subspecific level as subsp. \\i{}procerum\\i0{} (Lange) Böcher and subsp. \\i{}hyperboreum\\i0{} (Tolm.) Böcher. Recent studies confirm that \\i{}C. arcticum\\i0{} s.s. contains much morphological and genetical variation but do not support a further split into clearly definable geographical races or infraspecific taxa, as suggested by Hultén and Böcher (Brysting and Borgen 2000, Brysting and Elven 2000). \\par{}In western North America, \\i{}C. arcticum\\i0{} is replaced by \\i{}C. beeringianum\\i0{}, a species with which it tends to intergrade in eastern arctic areas.\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Cerastium arvense\\i0{} is variable in growth habit, hairiness, leaf shape, and flower size. A number of subspecies have been distinguished, especially from central Europe. Two subspecies are recognised by Morton (2005) in the \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{}: subsp. \\i{}arvense\\i0{} and subsp. \\i{}strictum\\i0{} Gaudin [Fl. Helv. 3: 245. 1828]. According to Morton, subsp. \\i{}strictum\\i0{} is a very variable, widely distributed taxon, which is difficult to circumscribe and to distinguish from the type subspecies. The two major ploidy levels (2\\i{}x\\i0{}, 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 36, and 4\\i{}x\\i0{}, 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 72) have been attached to the two entities \u0027\\i{}arvense\\i0{}\u0027 s.s. and \u0027\\i{}strictum\\i0{}\u0027 (Löve and Löve, in Löve 1975a), but correspondence between ploidy levels and the two subspecies accepted by Morton has not been fully established.\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Cerastium beeringianum\\i0{} is fairly well separated from \\i{}C. arcticum\\i0{}, but the two species tend to intergrade in the eastern part of the Canadian Arctic. Integradation between the two ploidy levels represented by \\i{}C. beeringianum\\i0{} and \\i{}C. arcticum\\i0{} is probably possible, but should not be assumed just because some specimens are difficult to identify. \\par{}Small plants with a distinct cushion-like growth and with small flowers borne on short pedicels are common in High Arctic areas. Similar dwarf plants are found in the northernmost Russian and Siberian areas and possibly also in Greenland. The name \\i{}C. bialynickii\\i0{} Tolm. has been generally applied for the Russian/Siberian dwarf plants, but if these plants are recognised as a distinct taxon, \\i{}C. bialynickii\\i0{} would not be the correct name for it. The type material of \\i{}C. bialynickii\\i0{} (in LE) is not significantly different from \\i{}C. beeringianum\\i0{}, as this taxon is typified (Petrovsky, Brysting, and Elven, in Elven et al. 2003), and \\i{}C. bialynickii\\i0{} is here considered a synonym of \\i{}C. beeringianum\\i0{}. Preliminary studies indicate that the \u0027arctic dwarf\u0027 might be recognisable as a taxon that is as yet nameless (Elven et al. 2003). \\par{}More or less glabrous plants are mainly found in southeastern areas, but also occur on continental North America opposite Victoria Island and on western Banks Island (specimens in O). These plants, usually with horizontal stems trailing along the ground, are taller and less compact than more northern plants. \\par{}Hultén (1937a, 1944, 1956) separated several infraspecific taxa within \\i{}C. beeringianum\\i0{}. Plants with leaves more or less glabrous were described as var. \\i{}glabratum\\i0{} Hultén and considered to be the result of gene exchange with \\i{}C. regelii\\i0{}; plants from Alaska, with large flowers and larger and more acute leaves, were described as var. \\i{}grandiflorum\\i0{} (Fenzl) Hultén; plants from the Rocky Mountains, with more glabrous leaves and very short and fine pubescence on the pedicels, were described as subsp. \\i{}earlei\\i0{} (Rydberg) Hultén. A serpentine and limestone form from southern Labrador and Newfoundland with a caespitose growth form, yellowish foliage, larger flowers, and larger seeds was considered subsp. \\i{}terrae-novae\\i0{} (Fernald and Wiegand) Hultén. This taxon is treated as a distinct species by Morton (2005), \\i{}C. terra-novae\\i0{} Fernald and Wiegand (personal communication, 2002).\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Cerastium cerastoides\\i0{} is gynodioecious (displaying female plants as well as hermaphrodites), and slightly protandrous (Warming 1920). The seeds develop fairly regularly even when flowering is late. Local dispersal takes place by rooting shoot fragments (Jonsell 2001a).\u003e","\u003cMature seeds have never been found in northern arctic populations, probably because the plants flower late. In these areas, most propagation is by bulbils borne in the shoot apices. \\i{}C. regelii\\i0{} has been found to be conspecific with the boreoarctic \\i{}C. jenisejense\\i0{} Hultén, a plant without bulbils and which flowers early in the season (Heide et al. 1990). These authors considered \\i{}C. jenisejense\\i0{} a morpho-type of \\i{}C. regelii\\i0{}, induced by different temperature and daylight regimes at lower latitudes. In the \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{} treatment, Morton (2005) recognises \\i{}C. gorodkovianum\\i0{} Schischkin as a separate species, similar to \\i{}C. regelii\\i0{} but more creeping in its habit. He notes that the two taxa simply may be growth forms of the same species and includes \\i{}C. jenisense\\i0{} as a synonym of \\i{}C. gorodkovianum\\i0{}. Here, both\\i{} C. gorodkovianum\\i0{} and \\i{}C. jenisense\\i0{} are included as synonyms of \\i{}C. regelii\\i0{}, following Heide et al. (1990). \\par{}The amphi-Atlantic part of the species has often been considered as a separate subspecies, subsp. \\i{}caespitosum\\i0{} (Malmgren) Tolm. \\par{}\\i{}Cerastium regelii\\i0{} differs from the other \\i{}Cerastium\\i0{} species in having more contracted growth, round glabrous leaves, and by the production of bulbils in the shoot apices. The hybrid \\i{}C. arcticum\\i0{} ×\\i{}regelii\\i0{} differs from \\i{}C. regelii\\i0{} in having elongated and pubescent leaves and flowering profusely from early in the season (Elven and Elvebakk 1996).\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Honckenya peploides\\i0{} is very variable in vegetative characters, which are easily modified by local conditions and to some degree clinal from south to north. However, three or more morphological variants are usually recognised, based on vegetative as well as seed characters: (1) subsp. \\i{}peploides\\i0{}, which is a non-arctic entity found on the coasts of Europe from northern (non-arctic) Norway south to Portugal, (2) subsp. \\i{}diffusa\\i0{}, which is circumpolar mainly in arctic and northern boreal zones, and (3) subsp. \\i{}major\\i0{} (Hooker) Hultén from the northern Pacific area (reaching arctic western Alaska). \\par{}The species has flowers with only female or male organs, as well as hermaphrodite flowers. The female flower has very small stamens and petals, while the hermaphrodites and males have larger petals and larger stamens. Female plants produce more seeds than hermaphrodites. In Norden (area treated by \\i{}Flora Nordica\\i0{}), this species is almost completely dioecious and bisexual flowers are very rare (Kurtto, in Jonsell 2001a). The species is efficiently spread by stolons and often forms extensive clones. The seeds are spread by sea currents.\u003e","","\u003cWolf et al. (1979b) reported on the taxonomy of the \\i{}Minuartia rossii\\i0{} complex, which they considered consisting of \\i{}M. austromontana \\i0{}S.J. Wolf and Packer, \\i{}M. elegans\\i0{}, and \\i{}M. rossii\\i0{}, and confined primarily to Arctic-Alpine North America. These authors noted that previously the taxa had been recognised at various taxonomic levels and found that morphological, cytological, and phytogeographical data support the recognition of the taxa at the specific level. They stated that the three taxa differ in several independent characters, especially in sepal and petal characters, and that these differences seem to be discontinuous and specific, rather than clinal. \\par{}The base chromosome number of the complex is \\i{}x \\i0{}\u003d 15, with \\i{}M. rossii\\i0{} having 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 58 and 60, \\i{}M. austromontana\\i0{} and \\i{}M. elegans\\i0{} both having 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 30 and 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 60. Wolf et al. (1979b) interpreted the tetraploid type as autotetraploid. \\par{}The three taxa have distinct geographical distributions. \\i{}Minuartia rossii\\i0{} occurs on Wrangel Island, High Arctic North America, Greenland, and Svalbard. \\i{}Minuartia elegans\\i0{} occurs in the Russian Far East, Alaska, Yukon, and south to Alberta. Collections from the Tundra Northwest expedition in 1999 (O and GBG) document this species as occurring in the western Canadian Arctic Archipelago. \\i{}Minuartia austromontana\\i0{} is confined primarily to the front ranges of the northern and central Rocky Mountains and is not found within the range of this flora. Wolf et al. (1979b) suggested that the distribution patterns probably are the result of Pleistocene survival of the taxa in three different areas: the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, the Beringian area, and south of the glaciation. \\par{}Wolf et al. (1979a) studied the flavonoids of the \\i{}M. rossii\\i0{} complex and identified nine glycosides based on the common aglycones quercetin and kaempferol and the rarer \\i{}C\\i0{}-glycoflavone isovitexin. No difference was noted in the flavonoid profiles between the two chromosome races of \\i{}M. elegans\\i0{}, and no geographical variation was observed in the three taxa of the complex.\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Minuartia rossii\\i0{} rarely flowers and relies almost exclusively on vegetative reproduction via bulbils (axillary or terminal leaf buds), which are easily detached and spread by wind or running water, and root very rapidly (Wolf et al. 1979b). Flowering plants occur in fairly dry sites, whereas reproduction by bulbils may dominate in wet, late sites. In Svalbard, ripe capsules and seeds are very rare and are formed only in favourable years (Elven and Elvebakk 1996). Porsild (1955) noted that \\i{}M. rossii\\i0{} flowers abundantly in favourable years, particularly in more southern regions. This observation is confirmed by Wolf et al. (1979b). \\par{}\\i{}Minuartia rossii\\i0{} is closely related to \\i{}M. stricta\\i0{}. Nannfeldt (1954) studied the relationship between these two taxa and recognised both as species.\\par{}\u003e","\u003cGlabrous or almost glabrous plants which have been treated as \\i{}Arenaria\\i0{} \\i{}propinqua\\i0{} Richardson occur scattered in otherwise normal populations and probably do not deserve taxonomic recognition (Elven et al. 2003).\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Minuartia stricta\\i0{} is closely related to \\i{}M. rossii\\i0{}. Nannfeldt (1954) studied the relationship between these two taxa and recognised both as species.\\par{}\"Arctic occurrences of this species are probably rare. There seems to be many misidentifications, partly of glabrous \\i{}M. rubella\\i0{} var. \\i{}propinqua\\i0{} and partly of \\i{}M. rossii\\i0{}\" (Elven et al. 2003). \\par{}\\i{}Minuartia dawsonensis\\i0{} is similar in many aspects to \\i{}M. stricta\\i0{} and has sometimes been synonymised with it. It is accepted as a separate species in most recent studies of \\i{}Minuartia\\i0{}. McNeill (1962) even placed it in a separate sect. \\i{}Sclerophylla\\i0{} Mattf. (Elven, personal communication, 2005).\u003e","\u003cCrow (1978) stated that the plants from North America and western Greenland differ from European plants of this taxon in having glandular trichomes on the upper portion of the pedicels and on the base of the calyx. While European plants are totally glabrous, the amount of glandular pubescence in the North American material is variable. Sparsely glandular pubescent plants are frequent, and occasionally glabrous specimens are encountered. Among the glandular pubescent plants examined, on average 70% of the pedicels exhibited glandular pubescence, while 30% of the pedicels of the same plants were glabrous. Crow (1978) concluded that separate nomenclatural recognition of European and North American material seemed unnecessary.\u003e","\u003cCrow (1978) noted that the name \\i{}Sagina intermedia\\i0{} has been widely used, but adopted \\i{}S. nivalis\\i0{} as the correct name for the taxon, stating that no original type material of either name appears to exist. Lindblom\u0027s description in 1838 and the even more detailed descriptions by Fries in 1842, given when he elevated the taxon to specific rank, clearly refer to the same taxon published as \\i{}S. intermedia\\i0{} by Fenzl in 1842. The name \\i{}S. nivalis\\i0{} (July 1842) has priority over \\i{}S. intermedia\\i0{} (October 1842; Elven et al. 2003). \\par{}\\i{}Sagina nivalis\\i0{}, which is usually an Arctic species in North America, occurs as a disjunct population in Alberta. Plants on Mt. Edith Cavell, Jasper National Park, representing morphologically good \\i{}S. nivalis\\i0{} (confirmed by chromosome count of 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 88, by J.K. Morton), occur mixed with \\i{}S. saginoides\\i0{}. Specimens appearing intermediate between the two taxa are present there and occur occasionally elsewhere in Jasper and Banff National Parks. \\par{}The neotype of the name \\i{}S. nivalis\\i0{}, on a specimen collected and annotated as such by Lindblom (even if after the publication), ensures a stable application of the name (Elven, personal communication, 2005).\\par{}Crow (1978) noted that there are several specimens from alpine habitats in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming which are suggestive of \\i{}S. nivalis\\i0{}. Although these 5-merous specimens are densely caespitose and the sepal margins are distinctly purple, they belong to \\i{}S. saginoides\\i0{}. However, a few 4- and 5-merous specimens from Colorado do appear to be truly intermediate between the two taxa. J.K. Morton (personal communication, 1976) has obtained an intermediate chromosome count of 2\\i{}n \\i0{}\u003d about 64 for one such specimen, which is interesting because (\\i{}S. saginoides\\i0{} 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 22; \\i{}S. nivalis\\i0{} 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 88). Hybrids have also been reported, quite frequently, from other regions (e.g., Norway), but never confirmed as such (Elven, personal communication, 2005).\u003e","\u003cCrow (1978) stated that \\i{}Sagina nodosa\\i0{} is the most clearly defined species of the genus and that its floral morphology most nearly represents that of the ancestral type. In this species, the petals (4.5-6 mm) are much longer than the sepals (3-4.5 mm long), and leaves of the upper main stem and lateral branches usually bear axillary fascicles of minute, succulent leaves, giving a \"knotted\" appearance. \\par{}Crow (1978) divided \\i{}S. nodosa\\i0{} into two subspecies, (i) subsp. \\i{}borealis\\i0{} with glabrous stems or with scattered glandular hairs at the nodes, pedicels, and calyx bases, and (ii) subsp. \\i{}nodosa\\i0{} with glandular hairs on the stems, pedicels, calyx bases, and frequently also the leaf margins. In North America, subsp. \\i{}borealis\\i0{} is widespread, whereas subsp. \\i{}nodosa\\i0{} occurs only on part of the eastern coast (possibly introduced from Europe). Crow (1978) noted that subsp. \\i{}nodosa\\i0{} is the more widespread subspecies in northern Europe, while subsp. \\i{}borealis\\i0{} is found only in the previously glaciated regions of northern Europe. \\par{}Karlsson, in Jonsell (2001a), reported that plants in Norden (the area treated by \\i{}Flora Nordica\\i0{}) vary not only in hairiness, but also in habit, length of shoots and leaves, flower size, and number of flowers and bulbils. Plants from glabrous populations (subsp. \\i{}nodosa\\i0{}) are often prostrate, have shorter stems, shorter rosette leaves, and usually more flowers per shoot, and produce few or no bulbils. Karlsson, in Jonsell (2001a), tentatively accepted the subspecies proposed by Crow (1978), but mentioned that a large part of the Nordic material cannot be assigned to one or the other of these two forms. \\par{}Polunin (1940b) described a form from Baffin Island, \\i{}S. nodosa\\i0{} f. \\i{}bulbillosa\\i0{}, which occurs totally without flowers and produces bulbils in the axils of cauline leaves. The disarticulation of these tiny fascicles of leaves in the fall is the normal mechanism of vegetative dispersal, which occurs with greatest frequency at higher latitudes. It is not restricted to sterile plants (Crow 1978). Similarly, purely bulbiliferous plants, not worthy of rank, occur throughout the range of subsp. \\i{}borealis\\i0{}, either as populations or within populations with some flowering.\u003e","\u003cThis is Wordsworth\u0027s Moss Campion of which he wrote:\\par{}\"Upon it\u0027s native bed... \\par{}There, cleaving to the ground, it lies\\par{}With multitude of purple eyes,\\par{}Spangling a cushion green like moss.\" \\par{}The leaves and branches of \\i{}S. acaulis\\i0{} form a compact cushion with an aerodynamic shape, which provides considerable protection from the drying winds of winter. Air flows over the cushion like the stream of air over an airplane wing, and snow easily covers the entire plant. In summer there is maximum exposed leaf surface for photosynthesis and minimum exposure to the elements (Burt 2000). \\par{}The numerous flowers are slightly fragrant and insect-pollinated. In addition to normal bisexual flowers and female flowers with rudimentary stamens (gynodioecy), bisexual flowers with reduced female organs are found (Jonsell 2001). \\par{}Abbott et al. (1995) contrasted the molecular diversity and derivations of populations of \\i{}S. acaulis\\i0{} and \\i{}Saxifraga oppositifolia\\i0{} from the High Arctic and more southern latitudes, based on a survey of allozyme diversity. They used populations of \\i{}Silene acaulis\\i0{} from Svalbard, Norway, Iceland, and Scotland and found that populations from the High Arctic (Svalbard above 76°N) contained high levels of diversity and were genetically similar to populations from more southern locations. A restriction site analysis of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) in \\i{}S. acaulis\\i0{} revealed that all populations contained a single identical cpDNA haplotype, except one population from Norway, which also contained a second haplotype. Abbott et al. (1995) suggested that \\i{}S. acaulis \\i0{}populations in the High Arctic have most likely been derived from immigrants that arrived from the south after the last glacial period, while the evidence suggested that \\i{}Saxifraga oppositifolia\\i0{} may have northern stocks that survived the last glaciation in High Arctic refugia. \\par{}The \u0027\\i{}exscapa\\i0{}\u0027 name has been used for the plants in the Amphi-Beringian area, but refers to a European endemic, according to \\i{}Flora Europaea\\i0{}, and is probably inapplicable in the Arctic. The correct name for the arctic-alpine Pacific plants might be subsp. \\i{}arctica\\i0{}, or subsp. \\i{}subacaulescens\\i0{} for the pedunculate ones (Elven et al. 2003). As genetic evidence at this time does not justify recognition of several taxa, the subspecies that have been proposed are not applied here.\u003e","\u003cIn the\\i{} Flora of North America\\i0{} treatment (Morton 2005), the North American arctic island species are treated as \\i{}S. involucrata\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}involucrata\\i0{}. Elven et al. (2003, 2005) suggest that the major northern arctic circumpolar entity within the very variable \\i{}S. involucrata\\i0{} complex should be recognised as subsp. \\i{}furcata\\i0{} (Raf.) (comb. nov. needed), characterised by sturdy flowering stems, which are densely tufted; several (usually 3) erect flowers; calyx campanulate to ovoid; petals white (or pink) and much exserted; seeds narrow-winged or unwinged and .\\par{}Within the \\i{}S. involucrata\\i0{} complex, two other taxa are distributed within the Canadian Arctic Archipelago: \\i{}S. sorensenis\\i0{} and \\i{}S. ostenfeldii\\i0{}. These taxa are related to \\i{}S. involucrata\\i0{} but are higher polyploids (possibly alloploids involving \\i{}S. involucrata\\i0{}) and have much more limited distributions.\\par{}\u003e","\u003cElven et al. (2003) noted that this is a northwestern North American \\endash{} Beringian taxon, with its main distribution in western North America but with only a few localities in the Islands (Victoria and Banks Islands). Popp et al. (2003) showed that this species, belonging to the \\i{}Silene involucrata\\i0{} aggregate, shares one genome from the \\i{}\u0027uralensis\u0027\\i0{} lineage and the \\i{}\u0027linnaeana\u0027\\i0{} lineage with both and a second genome from the \\i{}\u0027linnaeana\u0027\\i0{} lineage with \\i{}S. sorensenis\\i0{}. It differs from \\i{}S. sorensenis\\i0{} by having smaller seeds and calyces, shorter and less woolly pubescence, and overall by being a less sturdy plant. It differs from \\i{}S. involucrata\\i0{} by the wingless seeds and the more elliptic than campanulate calyx.\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Silene sorensenis\\i0{} is restricted to Greenland, northern parts of the Canadian Arctic Islands, and Wrangel Island. It is characterised by pale pink, much exserted petals, ovate-campanulate calyx, and small (ca. 1 mm) wingless seeds. It is usually separable from the other arctic \\i{}Silenes\\i0{} by its dense purplish pubescence, which tends to obscure the venation of the calyx (Morton, 2005). The flowering stems are usually stouter and stiffer than in \\i{}S. involucrata\\i0{}.\u003e","\u003cThe \\i{}Silene uralensis/wahlbergella\\i0{} complex is characterised by broad-winged seeds and comparatively little exserted petals. Within the complex, there is one very widespread, arctic circumpolar entity and several arctic-alpine, alpine, or boreal entities with much more restricted ranges. Elven et al. (2003) recognised the taxon occurring in the Canadian Arctic as \\i{}Silene uralensis\\i0{} (Rupr.) Bocquet subsp. \\i{}arctica\\i0{} (Th.Fr.) Bocquet (1967) and noted this is the only High Arctic entity of the aggregate. It occurs in northern Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Svalbard, Novaya Zemlya, and Vaigach. Only this entity, subsp. \\i{}arctica\\i0{}, is represented in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. \\par{}The naming of the major parts of this aggregate depends on how the relationship between the arctic circumpolar plant and the others is interpreted, as some of the alpine and arctic-alpine taxa were described earlier than the arctic one (Elven et al. 2003). \\par{}Bocquet (1969) accepted the local subspecies in Svalbard, subsp. \\i{}arctica\\i0{} (based on var. \\i{}arctica\\i0{} Th. Fr.). Petrovsky and Elven (in Elven et al. 2003) have studied specimens and found the Svalbard plant inseparable from the other northern arctic plants, and the \\i{}arctica\\i0{} name is therefore applicable to the major arctic circumpolar entity. In \\i{}Flora Nordica\\i0{} (Jonsell 2001a), Arto Kurtto treated Fennoscandian plants as a distinct species, \\i{}S. wahlbergella\\i0{}, and the arctic plant as \\i{}S. uralensis\\i0{} (Rupr.) Bocquet. \\par{}Morton (2005) uses \\i{}Silene uralensis\\i0{} (Rupr.) Bocquet subsp. \\i{}uralensis\\i0{} for the very widespread, arctic circumpolar entity within the complex. He recognises three subspecies of \\i{}S. uralensis\\i0{} in North America, of which only subsp. \\i{}uralensis\\i0{} is represented in the eastern Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Subspecies \\i{}porsildii\\i0{} Bocquet is an Alaskan endemic with very large seeds that have a broad rugose wing. Subspecies \\i{}ogilviensis\\i0{} (A.E. Porsild) Brunton is rare in scattered localities across the Low Arctic and is characterised by its taller, more slender, and usually glabrous stems. \\par{}\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Stellaria crassifolia\\i0{} is often confused with \\i{}S. humifusa\\i0{}, but it is a much more slender and delicate species with long pedicels sharply angled below the capsule. Leaf shape and size varies considerably, tending to be smaller and broader in exposed habitats. (Morton 2005). \\par{}Near its northern limit, \\i{}S. crassifolia\\i0{} does not normally produce viable seeds, depending entirely on vegetative reproduction by the formation of terminal, as well as axillary, wintering buds that develop at the tip of aerial stems or branches, and also at the tip of filiform and very fragile runners issuing from the lower leaf-axils, or from the subaerial stems (Kotilainen 1946, Porsild and Cody 1980).\u003e","\u003cThis species is often confused with \\i{}S. crassifolia\\i0{}, but it has thicker stems and fleshy leaves that wrinkle and tend to turn brownish when dried.\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Stellaria longipes\\i0{} is a highly polymorphic circumpolar species complex, and the treatment of the complex has varied from the recognition of one wide species (see Chinnappa 1985 for review) to the acceptance of more than 10 separate species by Hultén (1943, 1968) and Porsild and Cody (1980). \\par{}Philipp (1972), working with the Greenland populations, and Chinnappa and Morton (1974), using data from the whole range of the complex in North America, demonstrated that though there is wide variation in chromosome numbers 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 51 to 106, the major ploidy levels are 4\\i{}x\\i0{} (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 52), 6\\i{}x\\i0{} (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 78), and 8\\i{}x \\i0{}(2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 104). There is no correlation between chromosome number and the morphology of the plants. Furthermore, it has been possible to cross the different cytotypes and synthesise the range of chromosome numbers observed in natural populations (Chinnappa and Morton 1974). Pollen and seed fertility in these synthesised cytotypes were high, and it was concluded that because \\i{}S. longipes\\i0{} possesses features that encourage cross-pollination, such hybridisations frequently occur in nature. \\par{}Chinnappa and Morton (1976) did an extensive study of morphological variation in about 1500 herbarium specimens belonging to the complex and including all the named taxa. They concluded that all the variation is of a quantitative nature and shows no discontinuities, though there is some degree of association of characters, showing a north-to-south distribution that is suggestive either of clinal variation or of a phenotypic response to climate. \\par{}Chinnappa and Morton (1984, p. 72) concluded that \"polyploidy has ...played a role in the success of [\\i{}S. longipes\\i0{}]. The wide range of polyploids... their interfertility, and the high level of fertility in the progeny are unusual. These features permit the formation of a greater range of new genomes than outbreeding alone could produce. Also, polyploidy, by duplicating whole genotypes and gene associations on individual chromosomes, greatly increase the gene pool. This has two consequences. First, it vastly increases the range of possible gene combinations, and second, it buffers the system against the loss of genes either through chance or a transient change in selection pressures. These factors are of particular importance in the arctic and subarctic. [The changeable and very unreliable environment] not only places a premium on the development of new and adaptive genotypes but also results in the sudden and chance loss of whole populations or portions of populations. \\i{}Stellaria longipes\\i0{} provides...insight into the factors...that are enabling this species to become a successful and prolific weed as man increasingly disturbs the fragile environment of the Arctic.\" \\par{}Porsild (1957) recognised \\i{}S. longipes\\i0{} s.l. and provided a key to what he called four \"races\", allowing that these are \"none too well marked\". His key follows (p. 75): \\par{}\"1. Sepals glabrous......2\\par{}2. Flowers in the axils of scarious bracts or scarious-margined leaves (Amphi-Atlantic, arctic)... \\i{}S. crassipes\\i0{} \\par{}2.

They noted that some of the entities in Russia and North America may, however, be identical.\\par{}We have decided here to fully accept only a collective species. The circumpolar knowledge of the group is uneven, and there is a possible problem in duplicate naming of taxa on the North American and Russian side (Elven, personal communication, 2005). Experimental work with several molecular markers on carefully selected and morphologically characterised material should be attempted before a final decision is reached as how to consider the complex.\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Viscaria alpina\\i0{} has been placed in several different genera: \\i{}Viscaria\\i0{} (Rohrbach 1868, Williams 1896), \\i{}Lychnis\\i0{} (Chowdhuri 1957), \\i{}Steris\\i0{} (\\u352\\\u00278aourkov 1976), and \\i{}Silene\\i0{} (Greuter et al. 1984, Greuter 1995). We adopt the generic boundaries of the tribe Sileneae, as suggested by Oxelman et al. (1997) and Lidén et al. (2001) based on molecular data, and recognise the species as \\i{}Viscaria\\i0{} \\i{}alpina\\i0{} (L.) G. Don. \\par{}This species is fairly variable, and several infraspecific taxa have been recognised. Differences in Amphi-Atlantic populations have been noted, and the American plants have been given taxonomic rank as var. \\i{}americana\\i0{} or as subsp. \\i{}americana\\i0{}. \\par{}When Fernald (1940) described \\i{}Lychnis alpina\\i0{} L. var. \\i{}americana\\i0{}, he stated that the albino form of \\i{}americana\\i0{} is rare in comparison with the ordinary rosy-flowered plant. The North American plants are usually coarser than the European plants. Occasional collections from Iceland and Italy are as stout as the American plants, and some from Iceland and Norway have flowers approaching those of the North American plants in size. Dwarfed plants of var. \\i{}americana\\i0{}, especially from Greenland, may be as small as some European specimens. \\par{}Fernald (1940) provided the following comparison of characters: \\par{}\\b{}Radical leaves\\b0{} 1-3.5 cm long, 2-5 mm wide... var. \\i{}alpina\\i0{} \\par{}thicker and firmer, 1.5-6.5 cm long, 2-8 mm wide...var. \\i{}americana\\i0{} \\par{}\\b{}Cauline leaves\\b0{}: 2-4 pairs, the larger leaves 1-3 cm long, 2-5 mm broad... var. \\i{}alpina \\par{}\\i0{} 3-7 pairs, the larger leaves 1.5-5.5 cm long, 2.5-10 mm broad... var. \\i{}americana\\i0\\par{}\\b{}Stem diameter\\b0{}: at most 2 mm, var. \\i{}alpina\\par{}\\i0{} 2-4 mm (dried material)... var. \\i{}americana\\i0\\par{}\\b{}Calyx during anthesis\\b0{}: 3-5 mm long..var. \\i{}alpina \\par{}\\i0{} 5-7 mm long....var. \\i{}americana\\i0\\par{}\\b{}Petals\\b0{} (including claw) 6-8 (rarely -9) mm long, 3-3.5 (-4) mm broad... var. \\i{}alpina\\i0{} \\par{}8.5-14.5 mm long, 3-6 mm broad...var. \\i{}americana\\i0{} \\par{}The measurements given in the description above were taken from specimens collected on Baffin Island and are closer to those of var. \\i{}alpina \\i0{}than var. \\i{}americana\\i0{}. No reason was found for recognising Fernald\u0027s variety for the material. \\par{}The flowers of \\i{}Viscaria alpina\\i0{} are normally bisexual and protandrous, but functionally female plants with short and pale, rudimentary stamens occur in low numbers (Wesenberg, in Jonsell 2001a).\u003e","\u003cThis species is treated under the name \\i{}Bistorta\\i0{} in several references such as \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{} (Freeman and Hinds 2005), \\i{}Flora Europaea\\i0{}, and \\i{}Flora Nordica\\i0{}. \\par{}Russell (1940) performed ecological studies on arctic vegetation and found that \\i{}Oxyria digyna\\i0{} and \\i{}Persicaria vivipara \\i0{}(\\i{}Polygonum viviparum\\i0{}) showed adequate carbon assimilation for increased growth, but that low temperature and low nitrogen supply curbed the growth rate. Savile (1972) suggested that these restrictions halted growth soon enough to ensure adequate seed production in the short summer. \\par{}\"This bistort often grows in areas of high soil fertility, near animal dens, bird nesting sites, or human habitations. The pecan-shaped rhizomes have long been used by the Inuit, and the leaves and bulbils were often eaten. The bulbils are also sought by ptarmigan and small seed-eating birds\" (Burt 2000, p. 60). \\par{}Kellman (1882) stated that according to people in Chukotka, the rhizomes of this plant must be collected immediately after the snow leaves the ground and before the first leaves appear. Only the rhizome, which is the size on an unshelled peanut, is used. To find and collect it in spring is no easy task, but Kellman reported that the people he observed had surprisingly good results. Elven (personal communication, 2005) noted that it is easy to find, as the withered leaves remain over winter.\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Koenigia islandica\\i0{} is one of the few annual species on the Arctic islands. It is confined to areas where it receives protection in a pocket of still warm air on sunny days and also receives protection from the wind. It matures at a height less than 5 cm, so the growth period is at a minimum and all tissues remain close to the warm soil (Savile 1972). \\par{}Sørensen (1941) found that seeds of \\i{}Koenigia islandica\\i0{} germinate promptly in their first spring, even though it would seem advantageous for a dormancy delay of germination beyond the first year. \\par{}A centre of diversity of this circumpolar species in the mountains of southeastern Asia is indicated by the taller and more profusely branched plants that have less reduced 4- to 5-merous flowers found there. The other species in this genus are also found in this area of southeastern Asia (Hedberg 1997).\\par{}Dahl (1963) discussed the heat exchange of a wet vegetation surface and the ecology of \\i{}Koenigia islandica\\i0{}. It is a nice study of the thermic regulation of arctic-alpine plants and initiated the study of lethally high temperatures, restricting the range of alpine-arctic plants (Elven, personal communication, 2005).\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Oxyria digyna\\i0{} is often deeply pigmented with abundant anthocyanic red pigment. The amount of pigment (or its occurrence in the coloured rather than the pale form) is genetically controlled in \\i{}Oxyria digyna\\i0{} in which colour is rather constant, generally, within a clonal colony, but can vary sharply between clones (Savile 1972). \\par{}Russell (1940) performed ecological studies on arctic vegetation and found that \\i{}O. digyna\\i0{} and \\i{}Persicaria vivipara\\i0{} showed adequate carbon assimilation for increased growth but that low temperature and low nitrogen supply curbed the growth rate. Savile (1972) suggested that these restrictions halted growth soon enough to ensure adequate seed production in the short summer.\\par{}Porsild (1953) claimed that this species prefers somewhat shaded slopes and ravines, where snow accumulates during the winter and provides moisture that lasts throughout the growing season. In such places the fresh green leaves of the mountain sorrel may be found all summer. It responds wonderfully to manure, and in the rich soil under bird cliffs and near Eskimo dwelling may form large, luxurious beds. The succulent, juicy leaves and young stems are somewhat acid when raw, but most refreshing and thirst-quenching. When cooked, their flavour and appearance resembles spinach. In Greenland, a very tasty dish, not unlike stewed rhubarb, is prepared from the sweetened juice thickened with a small amount of rice or potato flour. The Eskimo of Greenland and Alaska eat the fresh leaves of the mountain sorrel mixed with seal blubber.\u003e","\u003cElven (personal communication, 2005) commented that the (in)famous \"sourdock\" of the Alaskan Eskimos is made from \\i{}Rumex arcticus\\i0{}, seal blubber, either blueberries or crowberries (or both), and several sessions of fermentation resupplied with fresh plant material. \"I have tried it, and the taste (very special) lingered for days.\"\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Montia\\i0{} is the only representative of this family in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. It may be more widespread, and should be looked for at early Hudson Bay trading post sites, as it was found growing in damp mud near the shore at the Ward Inlet site on Frobisher Bay. \\par{}The reasons for treating \\i{}M. lamprosperma\\i0{} Cham. [described from Alaska: Unalaska] as a synonym of \\i{}M. fontana\\i0{} L. were presented by Moore (1963), Bot. Not. 116: 16-30, and confirmed by the monographic studies of Nilsson (1967). \\par{}Miller (2003) noted that \\i{}M. fontana\\i0{} displays a multitude of forms, varying in stature, leaf shape, and seed size. Segregate species, varieties, and subspecies have been named. Based on his study of worldwide collections, much of the variation is attributable to phenotypic differentiation produced by local environmental conditions and unrelated to genetic variation. Miller (2003) stated that until macromolecular or other studies shed light on the variation in \\i{}M. fontana\\i0{}, it seems pointless to recognise infraspecific taxa or segregate species.\u003e","\u003cLefèbvre and Vekemans (1994) reported on the results of phenetic analysis, using multivariate methods on several hundreds of herbarium specimens of \\i{}Armeria maritima\\i0{}. Two subspecies occupying distinct territories were recognised: \\i{}A. maritima\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}californica\\i0{}, occurring under temperate climates along the Pacific Coast from Vancouver Island to California, and \\i{}A. maritima \\i0{}subsp. \\i{}sibirica\\i0{}, [\u003d \\i{}A. scabra\\i0{}] found in arctic and subarctic areas. The latter can be easily distinguished by its glabrous calyces. The morphological variation between subsp. \\i{}californica\\i0{} and subsp. \\i{}sibirica\\i0{} is continuous, and some overlap occurs. The best diagnostic characters are two ratios: sheath length to flower head width, and outer involucral bract length to flower head width. Geographic trends are obvious: a reduction in plant size, with increasing latitude, and an increase in frequency from west to east. The dimorphic subsp. \\i{}maritima \\i0{}was maintained by these authors because of its distinct breeding system (papillate stigma associated with finely reticulate pollen, and smooth stigma associated with coarsely reticulate pollen). Subspecies \\i{}maritima\\i0{} is only found in south Greenland, and some specimens are morphologically similar to eastern monomorphic plants. \\par{}In discussions leading to the treatment of this species in Elven et al. (2003), Elven noted we had two options, either to treat the entities as species or as subspecies (Elven 2003, personal communication). The two entities which reach the North Atlantic area (northern Russia, northern Fennoscandia, Iceland, Greenland) appear quite distinct, and from a regional viewpoint, could be accepted as species. When the circumpolar variation is considered it becomes more problematic to uphold the taxa as distinct species. Elven et al. (2003) proposed recognising two major and mainly allopatric entities which replace each other circumpolarly: one mainly temperate North Atlantic (\\i{}\u0027maritima\u0027\\i0{} s.s.), and one arctic and nearly circumpolar (\\i{}\u0027scabra\u0027\\i0{}, \\i{}\u0027sibirica\u0027\\i0{} or \\i{}\u0027labradorica\u0027\\i0{}). A third Beringian (\\i{}\u0027arctica\u0027\\i0{}) entity has been indicated but is ambiguous and is currently included in this taxon. At species level the correct name for the arctic entity is \\i{}A. scabra\\i0{} (Elven et al. 2005).\\par{}Porsild (1957) suggested that a western race, subsp. \\i{}arctica\\i0{} (Cham.) Hultén, in which the grooves between the ribs of the calyx tube are glabrous may be the taxon occurring in the westernmost islands.\\par{}Horticultural varieties of \\i{}Armeria\\i0{} are sold as a garden perennial in southern Canada.\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Rhodiola rosea\\i0{} is in a relatively advanced group of the Crassulaceae. Most plants are male or female, but occasionally plants have both male and female flowers in the same cyme. \\par{}Elven et al. (2003) noted that the common name Rose-root is a reference to the rootstocks possessing the scent of rose petals. \\par{}Hultén (1968) excluded the Siberian and northwestern American plants from subsp. \\i{}rosea\\i0{}, whereas Petrovsky, in Yurtsev [Fl. Arct. URSS 9-1, 1984], accepted it as occurring up to the Bering Strait. The majority of the 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 22 chromosome counts seem to come from the North Atlantic and western parts of Russia. Hultén and Fries (1986) mapped what they call \u0027yellow-flowered taxa\u0027 for Siberia, Russian Far East, and Seward Peninsula, but this is not automatically the same as subsp. \\i{}rosea\\i0{} in the concept here. Some critical evaluation of material is necessary before this entity is fully accepted from Siberia and the amphi-Beringian areas. \\par{}The \\i{}\u0027arctica\u0027\\i0{} entity was synonymised with \\i{}R. rosea\\i0{} s.s. by Korobkov in Elven et al. (2003). It occurs in the northern and upper parts of the range of subsp. \\i{}rosea\\i0{}. High mountain plants of Fennoscandia are inseparable from the arctic plants, and the transition seems to be very even. Elven and Korobkov (in Elven et al. 2003) suggest that there probably is no need for a separate high alpine-arctic entity.\u003e","\u003cPorsild (1964) used the species name \\i{}Myriophyllum exalbescens\\i0{} Fernald and reported a single collection from the west coast of Baffin Island as the only collection from the Arctic Archipelago. We are aware of four other collections since then. \\par{}Aiken and Cronquist (1988) explained why the name \\i{}M. exalbescens\\i0{} falls into synonymy under \\i{}M. sibiricum\\i0{}, which they lectotypified. \\par{}The first collections from the Arctic Archipelago reflected the short and cold growing season available for submerged aquatic plants. They were usually 10-15 cm tall, with evidence of the previous season\u0027s turions in a characteristically curved base to the plants associated with smaller, thicker, dark green leaves. Plants collected on Baffin Island, before the end of August, were already developing the next season\u0027s overwintering turions without having flowered. However, in 2001, flowering plants were found on Southampton Island. They were beginning to flower in early July, and were growing in a very shallow pond, and had experienced a period of weather with temperatures over 20°C for several days. \\par{}While definitive identification is difficult on vegetative specimens, the variation in the shape of overwintering turions and the transition between turion leaves and summer leaves in one sample suggests that \\i{}M. verticillatum\\i0{} may also be present in the Arctic Archipelago (Aiken et al. 1979, Aiken and Waltz 1979).\\par{}\u003e","\u003cPolunin (1940) recognised the taxon as \\i{}Chrysosplenium alternifolium\\i0{} var. \\i{}tetrandrum\\i0{}, indicating that he considered the typical variety to have 6-8 anthers and to be absent from eastern North America. He claimed that all Canadian Arctic Archipelago material belongs to the well-marked variety (var. \\i{}tetrandrum\\i0{}), having only four stamens and smaller and more rounded leaves with fewer crenations. Porsild (1957) used the name \\i{}C. tetrandrum\\i0{} and noted that the number of stamens in Canadian Arctic material is usually 4, but not uncommonly 6 or 8. \\par{}Elven et al. (2003) noted that taxonomy in this genus is complicated, and several of the few arctic representatives are uncertain. This concerns the possible racial division of \\i{}C. alternifolium\\i0{}, the distinctness of \\i{}C. tetrandrum\\i0{} as a species from \\i{}C. alternifolium\\i0{}, and the ambiguities of \\i{}C. rosendahlii\\i0{}. \\par{}Packer (1963) described \\i{}C. rosendahlii\\i0{} Packer based on type material collected on Somerset Island, but this was not taken up by Scoggan (1978). \\par{}Elven et al. (2003) noted that the two essential differences between \\i{}C. tetrandrum\\i0{} and \\i{}C. alternifolium\\i0{} are the ploidy level and the fewer stamens in the former. Otherwise, there are some quantitative and habitual characters, and the plants look very different. This is perhaps enough for species, but treatment as subspecies of \\i{}C. alternifolium\\i0{} is also an option that has been proposed several times. \\par{}Elven et al. (2005) noted \"The combination \\i{}C. alternifolium\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}tetrandrum\\i0{} was first made by A. Blytt and O.C. Dahl (1904), [Haandb. Norges Fl. 411]. Jalas et al. (1999) stated that the book was printed in October 1906, while Cajander made the same combination later in 1906 in Suomen Kasvio 325. However, Blytt and Dahl\u0027s work was printed and distributed in fascicles, and fascicle 26 where \\i{}Chrysosplenium\\i0{} appeared was distributed already in 1904. Both combinations predate the often cited combination of Hultén Fl. Aleut. Isl. 217, 1937.\"\u003e","\u003cThis species belongs in the genus \\i{}Micranthes\\i0{}, and will be treated as such in Volume 8 of \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{} (L. Brouillet, Université de Montréal, personal communication, 2006). The new combination by R.J. Gornall is forthcoming but has not yet been published. \\i\\par{}\\i0{}Polunin (1940) recognised this taxon as wide-ranging latitudinally, and fairly common almost everywhere, growing chiefly on damp humus soil or among mosses. He observed that this species varies in its general robustness, from plants with many thick and much branched stems up to 30 cm in height. More commonly occurring plants are tiny rosettes supporting a single very slender unbranched stem only 8-10 cm high. The taxon was treated as \\i{}S. stellaris\\i0{} var. \\i{}comosa\\i0{} Retzius by Polunin (1940).\\par{}In the Arctic Archipelago, the flowers are replaced by an abundance of little bulbils, although two or three of the main branches may still bear terminal flowers. There is very often a single flower crowning the central axis, except on plants growing in extreme habitats.\\par{}This species is always gemmiferous, but sometimes with one apical flower, very rarely with several (Hultén\u0027s \\i{}\u0027multiflora\u0027\\i0{}). Some seed-set has been observed, but only once or twice in modern botanical history. It is certainly a fairly rare phenomenon. It has sometimes been hypothesised as a gemmiferous derivative from a hybrid involving \\i{}S. stellaris\\i0{}, but the obvious closest now-living relative is the Asian \\i{}S. redofskyi\\i0{} Adams (Elven, personal communication, 2005).\\par{}Molau (1992) discussed the occurrence of sexual reproduction in this species.\u003e","\u003cPolunin (1940) noted that this remarkable species, which in far northern Spitsbergen grows taller than almost any other plant, is of limited distribution but somewhat variable in the Canadian Arctic. Most individuals are very coarse, with a thick erect axis 25-30 cm high, but in some cases the axis is much shorter and more slender, with the leaves being smaller and rounder, so that the plants take on the aspect of \\i{}S. nivalis\\i0{}. Indeed transitions (hybrids?) appear to occur between the two species. \\i{}Saxifraga hieracifolia\\i0{} also varies markedly in the distance between successive nodes of the mature fruiting inflorescences. All the material from within the Canadian Arctic Archipelago belongs to the typical variety. \\par{}This mainly circumpolar arctic-alpine species is absent in some arctic regions. \"A closely related species is probably \\i{}S. integrifolia\\i0{} Hooker (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 38, 56), from northern Cordillera. It shows considerable eco-morphological plasticity, and has a different chromosome number\" (Zhmylev, in Elven et al. 2003). \\par{}\u003e","\u003cThis is a circumpolar arctic-alpine species that in high-arctic regions may be confused with \\i{}M. tenuis\\i0{}, owing to its small size. It differs from that taxon in having more densely hairy flowering stems with much longer hairs, capitate flowering heads with flowers on very short pedicels, and a sharp separation between the leaf blades and the petioles, and in being hexaploid versus diploid, as in \\i{}M. tenuis\\i0{}.\\par{}Healy and Gillespie (2005) investigated the systematics of Canadian Arctic Island members of this complex from 157 specimens, using 23 morphological characters. They noted that most European studies suggest that the \\i{}nivalis\\i0{} complex includes two distinct species: \\i{}M.nivalis \\i0{}s.s. and \\i{}M. tenuis,\\i0{} but , inconsistencies in chromosomal counts, variability in morphological keys and descriptions, and specimens with intermediate morphology have led to different taxonomic interpretations of the complex in North America. Principal component analysis of the morphological data revealed two adjacent clusters, corresponding to the two taxa and consistent with a close morphological similarity and possible presence of hybrids. A preliminary restriction site analysis of five non-coding regions of the chloroplast genome, indicated a length difference in the trnT-trnF region between \\i{}M. nivalis\\i0{} and \\i{}M. tenuis\\i0{}, but no difference in restriction sites for any of the regions. The authors concluded that their results confirm that in the Canadian Arctic, the \\i{}S. nivalis\\i0{} complex consists of two closely related, largely sympatric species, with morphological variability and possible hybrids.\\par{}Elven (personal communication, 2005) noted that the same pattern appears from studies by the Brochmann group at Oslo. Tetraploid (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 40) hybrids have not yet been found in the Canadian Arctic. There may be possible single hybrid individuals in mixed populations, but there is as of yet no support for a propagating tetraploid entity here. Tetraploid individuals and a putative tetraploid entiy in the \\i{}M. nivalis\\i0{} complex have been found in North America outside of the arctic (Krause and Beamish 1973; Gervais et al. 1995) and in the Russian Arctic (Devyatov et al. 1997).\\par{}Anatomically, this species was considered to be a mesophyte (Galloe 1910) because the leaves have prominent stomata upon both surfaces, thin-walled epidermal cells, and a spongy parenchyma. \\par{}Polunin (1940) considered the typical form to be the most frequent in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. He indicated that it is rather coarse, growing generally 8-20 cm high, and occurring almost everywhere. He noted that \\i{}Micranthes kumlienii\\i0{} Small was described as a new species from within the area. Polunin (1940) was unable to separate it from the species described here, either on the basis of the original diagnosis or on the type material he had seen, and he considered that it clearly belonged to \\i{}M. nivalis\\i0{}. The chief distinction on which \\i{}Micranthes kumlienii\\i0{} was recognised was in having unusually fine dentation of the leaves, but this is a variable character.\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Micranthes tenuis\\i0{} has been treated either as a distinct species or as a variety of \\i{}M. nivalis\\i0{}, and both were previously treated within the genus \\i{}Saxifraga\\i0{}. Polunin (1940) commented that the two taxa are difficult to separate and suggested the need for breeding and cytological studies before distinguishing them at the species level. Subsequently, Porsild (1957) and Porsild and Cody (1980) recognised \\i{}S. tenuis\\i0{} as a distinct species in the Canadian Arctic, as it was in Europe (Webb 1964, 1993) and Greenland (Böcher et al. 1968, 1978). More recently Scoggan (1978) and Aiken et al. (1998) treated the two taxa as varieties of \\i{}S. nivalis\\i0{}. \\par{}Healy and Gillespie (2005) investigated the systematics of the \\i{}S. nivalis\\i0{} (\u003d \\i{}M. nivalis\\i0{}) species complex in the Canadian Arctic islands using morphology and chloroplast DNA restriction site data (see also under \\i{}M. nivalis\\i0{}). Their results supported the recognition of two closely related, largely sympatric species, \\i{}S. nivalis \\i0{}and \\i{}S. tenuis\\i0{}. The two species can be distinguishable based on both molecular and cytological characters and have morphological characters that correspond to these differences. While no morphological characters gave 100% separation, numerous characters, both quantitative and qualitative, showed statistically significant differences. However, both species showed considerable morphological variability, and the presence of intermediate specimens suggests they may hybridise. \\i{}Micranthes tenuis\\i0{} is most common in the High Arctic and eastern Canadian Arctic islands; its range is included within that of the more widespread and common \\i{}M. nivalis\\i0{}. Although their habitat preferences differ (\\i{}M. tenuis\\i0{} preferring wetter sites), there is considerable overlap, with the two taxa sometimes occurring in mixed populations.\\par{}\\i{}Micranthes tenuis\\i0{} may be distinguished from \\i{}M. nivalis\\i0{} by its typically more delicate habit, narrower sparsely hairy flowering stems with short fine hairs, open cyme with fewer flowers on distinct pedicels, and usually pink petals.\u003e","\u003cPolunin (1940) commented that although this species is in places quite frequent, it does not appear to have been properly recorded from within the Arctic islands. It is generally around 10 cm in height in the late flowering or fruiting condition, but varies somewhat in the size and robustness of the leaves and in the length of the petals, \"which are said to equal the calyx lobes, but which in some of my otherwise perfectly \u0027good\u0027 specimens, exceed the calyx-lobes by as much as one third.\" (p. 271)\u003e","\u003cPolunin (1940, p. 262) commented that \"unlike most other members of the genus, and in spite of the fact that Engler and Irmscher (1919, p. 466) introduced it as \u0027Typus polymorphus \\i{}S. aizoides\\i0{}\u0027, this species does not appear to vary much in our area, where it grows generally as a loose mat or tuft about 6 (4-10) cm high. It seems to be as strongly calciphilous as any species; having now for several years past made a point of testing the soil around the roots of specimens met in ordinarily acidic country in the north, and [always found] at least some scraps that would effervesce strongly with HCl\". \\par{}Elven et al. (2003) noted that \"the arctic plants in Svalbard, Greenland, and northern Canada differ from the European ones (which reach the arctic in northern Norway)in, e.g., growth form, leaf shape, inflorescence shape, petal size and shape, and petal colour. Some racial differentiation might be involved.\" That is the reason for Engler and Irmscher\u0027s \"typus polymorphus\"; the European plants they mostly studied are very polymorphic, but mainly in one character. There are three main flower colour morphs, with a few intermediates: yellow, orange with red dots, and reddish purple. Elven (personal communication, 2005) remarked that all the High Arctic plants he has seen are yellow-flowered and also differ from the yellow-flowered European mainland ones in some other, small features.\u003e","\u003cElven et al. (2003) noted that the \\i{}S. cernua\\i0{} aggregate consists of a series of taxa from diploid to high-polyploid levels, accompanied by a transfer from sexual seed propagation to propagation by bulbils (and runners). The three arctic taxa are fairly different but related. Their relationships to the probably mainly diploid, sexual, and more southern \\i{}S. sibirica\\i0{} L. is also fairly clear that it is a circumpolar arctic-alpine species propagating mainly vegetatively (by pseudovivipary) and probably it is a complex of two close species, formed as a result of polyploidisation in the pseudoviviparous races of \\i{}S. radiata\\i0{} and \\i{}S. sibirica\\i0{}. Seed reproduction does occur in \\i{}S. cernua\\i0{}, although fairly rarely and as a small proportion of the total reproduction. \\par{}Porsild (1957) described this species as \"nodding in youth\". Field observations are that the nodding may occur before and after anthesis. \\par{}Polunin (1940) recognised taxa that we have not recognised as distinct. These were as follows: \\par{}1. subsp. \\b\\i{}cernua\\b0\\i0{}, the usual one occurring throughout the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. \\par{}2. var. \\b\\i{}exiliodes\\b0\\i0{} Polunin. Plants occurring on the mainland regions of the Northwest Territories. \\par{}3. forma \\b\\i{}latibracteata\\b0\\i0{} (Fernald and Weath.) Polunin. This taxon had been recognised as a variety, but Polunin noted that while it initially appeared to have the geographical delimitation of a true variety, it has since been found to be a merely frondose phase developed almost everywhere that the species grows in humid places among rocks in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. It had been distinguished on the characters: leaf blades larger, 10-55(-70) mm long, 8-20(-25) mm wide; 5-8 lobed. \\par{}4. forma \\b\\i{}bulbillosa\\b0\\i0{} Engler and Irmsch. \"\\i{}bulbillis nigris permultis dense instructis\\i0{}\". Polunin (1940) described this as a \\b\\i{}forma crassa\\b0\\i0{}, which in our area has been collected on the west coast of Hudson Bay (in the case of Macoun\u0027s Fullerton material \"on wet refuse from dog stalls\") and on the closely adjacent Southampton Island. It forms a marked contrast to the slender and graceful var. \\b\\i{}exilioides\\b0\\i0{} of the same region. \\par{}5. forma \\b\\i{}ramosa\\b0\\i0{}. A rare form that Polunin (1940) considered to have been collected in the Arctic Archipelago. \\par{}Porsild (1957) and Hultén (1968), Porsild and Cody (1980) did not recognise any of the intraspecific taxa in the above list. \\i{}Saxifraga cernua\\i0{} is one of the chief plants in the High Arctic. It has a very wide range of tolerance to most environmental conditions, occurring in almost all habitats from wet to very dry and sheltered to exposed, and doing especially well in manured areas and snow patches. It is highly resistant to frost. This taxon appears to be a phenotypically plastic one in which various expressions have been named. \\par{}\\i{}Saxifraga cernua\\i0{} was one of seven arctic species studied at Truelove Inlet, Devon Island (Atkin et al. 1993), for their ability to utilise nitrate nitrogen under field conditions. \\i{}Saxifraga cernua\\i0{}, \\i{}S. oppositifolia\\i0{}, \\i{}Cerastium alpinum, Oxyria digyna\\i0{}, and \\i{}Papaver radicatum\\i0{} s.l. were able to use nitrate nitrogen, while \\i{}Dryas integrifolia\\i0{} and \\i{}Salix arctica\\i0{} showed little utilisation. Porsild (1957, 1964) and Porsild and Cody (1980) recognised a single taxon for this species and did not accept any of the four intraspecific taxa recognised by Polunin (1940). No reason to do so has been found. \\par{}Molau (1992) discussed the occurrence of sexual reproduction in this species. \\par{}Kjølner et al. (2004) studied the clonal diversity in \\i{}S. cernua\\i0{} using amplified fragment length polymorphisn and random amplified polymorphic DNA markers.\u003e","\u003cThis is a circumpolar arctic-alpine species that is complicated and poorly studied. \"Some forms have been described as species. The majority of botanists now regard \\i{}S. cespitosa\\i0{} as a polymorphic species with several morphologically poorly differentiated races\" (Zhmylev, in Elven et al. (2003)). \\par{}This polymorphous species varies greatly in form and size with local conditions. It forms loose stands with branched inflorescences growing 20 cm or more high in sheltered rocky or manured places and dense cushions bearing a few unifloral axes, sometimes only 2 or 3 cm high in unfavourable situations. Distinct taxa have been recognised based on this variation. We have not maintained the three that Porsild (1957) and Porsild and Cody (1980) recognised as occurring in northern Canada. They are as follows: \\par{}1. subsp. \\b\\i{}cespitosa\\b0\\i0{} (\u003d subsp. \\i{}eucespitosa\\i0{} Engl. and Irmsch. an invalid name). Flowers relatively large, 8-10 mm wide, usually 3, rarely 1 or 2, Amphi-Atlantic subarctic. \\par{}2. subsp. \\b\\i{}uniflora\\b0\\i0{} (R. Br.)Porsild. Flowers smaller, 4-7 mm wide, mostly solitary, calyx purplish black, circumpolar with large gaps. \\par{}3. subsp. \\b\\i{}exaratoides\\b0\\i0{} (Simm) Engl. and Irmsch. emend. Porsild. Flowers mostly 3, calyx greenish purple, endemic to Paleozoic parts of Hudson Bay region, north to Ellesmere Island (Porsild 1955). \\par{}Polunin (1940, p. 257) observed that this is \"one of the commonest and hardiest of arctic plants, having such a wide range of tolerance to most environmental conditions that it can grow in almost any habitat. However, it prefers open clayey plains and sandy or gravelly seashores or exposed ridges, being unable to withstand much competition .... and hence found only occasionally in closed communities\". \\par{}Whittaker (1993), studying plant population patterns in the Storbreen glacier foreland succession, 61°35\u0027N, 8°E, found that \\i{}S. cespitosa\\i0{} and \\i{}Arabis alpina\\i0{} L. are visually the most characteristic forbes of the youngest ground. Both species peaked in local frequency within 30 years of deglaciation in sites close to the glacier snout and subject to severe physical disturbance by periglacial activity. They had virtually disappeared from the vegetation within approximately 50 years.\\par{}Crawford et al. (1994) found a uniquely high level of anoxic tolerance in Spitsbergen populations of this species and \\i{}S. cernua, S. foliolosa\\i0{},\\i{} S. hieracifolia\\i0{}, and \\i{}S. oppositifolia\\i0{}. Plants have the ability to maintain turgid green leaves throughout a period of anoxia and into the recovery phase. This is unusual, as leaves normally loose turgor and wither rapidly when deprived of oxygen. Tests on more southern populations from Norway, Iceland, and Scotland failed to find equivalent ability to survive oxygen deprivation. This suggests a different evolutionary history and the idea that some arctic populations may have survived the Pleistocene epoch at high latitudes in ice-free polar deserts. \\par{}\\i{}Saxifraga cespitosa\\i0{} is considered a \\lquote{}short-distance disperser\\rquote{} and a selfing polypoid (Tollefsrud et al. 1998). \\par{}North American authors as late as Porsild and Cody (1980) have recognised several races as subspecies (see above), and these races may possibly represent some reality, but the problem is that the variation has not been treated in a similar way in northwestern Europe or Russia. In Russia, subsp. \\i{}monticola\\i0{} (Small) A.E. Porsild is recognised for Russian Far East (as \\i{}S. monticola\\i0{} (Small) Fedde), whereas all other material is combined in \\i{}S. cespitosa\\i0{}. Note that \\i{}\u0027monticola\u0027\\i0{} is an American name and that Porsild and Cody considered it as a Cordilleran endemic (not as a Russian or amphi-Beringian plant). The type of Small\u0027s \\i{}Muscaria monticola\\i0{} is as follows: Canada: Alberta, Banff Natl. Park, Tunnel Mt., 23.06.1899, leg. W.C.McCalla 2288 (NY) holotype (Elven, personal communication, 2005).\\par{}This approach was followed by Zhmylev, in Elven et al. (2003). In Svalbard, Rönning (1996) recognised some characteristic yellow-flowered plants with half-closed flowers and narrow petals as a separate \\i{}S. aurea\\i0{} (Hada\\u269\\\u00273f) Rönning, a name that is a homonym several times. Such plants may differ in some genetic markers (Brochmann unpublished) and have their own ecology, mainly in snowbeds. However, similar plants occur as populations elsewhere, such as, occasionally in southern and northern Norway (Elven et al. 2003).\u003e","\u003cElven et al. (2003) noted that this species is superficially similar to \\i{}S. oppositifolia\\i0{}, but differs in its grey-green foliage and alternate leaves. It was first collected on the Arctic Archipelago in 1968. It is possibly under-collected, as it resembles lichens when not flowering. \"It is an Amphi-Beringian mainly arctic species, closely related to \\i{}S. hemisphaerica\\i0{} Hooker f. and Thoms., distributed in the Himalayas high mountains\" (Zhmylev, in Elven et al. (2003).\u003e","\u003cPolunin (1940) recognised both var. \\i{}hirculus\\i0{} and var. \\i{}propinqua\\i0{} as occurring in the Canadian Arctic. Porsild (1957) indicated that var. \\i{}hirculus\\i0{} is a circumpolar arctic-alpine species and considered that only var. \\i{}propinqua\\i0{} occurs in the eastern Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Polunin (1940) noted that this taxon exhibits considerable variation in our area. Hedberg (1967), in a study of taxonomic differentiation in \\i{}S. hirculus\\i0{}, found that field fixations of specimens from Arctic Canada yielded two chromosome numbers, 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 16, for plants from northern Canada, Victoria and Southampton Island, and northern Alaska (10 counts). He also reported one triploid count (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 24) as \\i{}\u0027propinqua\u0027\\i0{}) from Cornwallis Island. All the plants he assigned to subsp. \\i{}propinqua\\i0{}. \\par{}Hedberg (1992) argued that \\i{}S. hirculus\\i0{} s.l. is an arctic-boreal aggregate developed from the very diverse \u0027Himalayan\u0027 centre of sect. \\i{}Ciliatae\\i0{} (he stated that 54 species were known from Nepal alone). He accepted one northern species with four subspecies, three of which are present in the Arctic: a tetraploid subsp. \\i{}hirculus\\i0{} in European Russia, Siberia, Alaska, and Canada; a diploid subsp. \\i{}propinqua\\i0{} in eastern Chukotka, Alaska, Canada, and northeastern Greenland; and a tetraploid subsp. \\i{}compacta\\i0{} in eastern Greenland, Iceland, Svalbard, northeastern Russia, Siberia, Russian Far East, Alaska, and northwesternmost Canada. A diploid subsp. \\i{}coloradensis\\i0{} Hedberg is recognised in southwestern USA: Colorado. Hedberg (1992) presented morphological and cytological support for his proposal. His detailed cytotaxonomic study of the species as a whole concluded that most of the material of \\i{}S. hirculus\\i0{} studied could be easily distributed between these above-named four morphologically and geographically distinguishable populations and that they deserved taxonomic recognition although intermediates were found wherever the populations met. He indicated that only subsp. \\i{}propinqua\\i0{} occurs in the eastern Canada Arctic. \\par{}Zhmylev (in Elven et al. 2003) considerd \\i{}S. hirculus\\i0{} as a circumpolar arctic-boreal species of considerable morphological variability. Shortly, rhizomatous, diploid and tetraploid plants (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 16, 32), often treated as subsp. \\i{}propinqua\\i0{}, are found in high-arctic regions and mountain ridge tundra. In southern tundra, in wet mires and damp meadows are found tetraploid plants with long rhizomes, subsp. \\i{}hirculus\\i0{}. However, the other characters (e.g., shape of petals and sepals, flowers number) are only slightly correlated with growth form. Zhmylev (in Elven et al. 2005) proposed that \"ecological-morphological races of \\i{}S. hirculus\\i0{} should not be accepted at subspecific or specific rank.\" Elven and Murray (in Elven et al. 2005) \"tentatively accept his conclusion and propose informal entry of Hedberg\u0027s entities. Molecular studies could be rewarding in this intriguing complex. Note that Hedberg (1992) only mapped and reported material he had inspected.\"\\par{}Warncke et al. (1993) listed 76 species of insects visiting \\i{}S. hirculus\\i0{} at the only site where it occurs in Switzerland. Based on the number of flower visits, they found four species were dominant, and only two of the 76 species were among the visitors to flowers of \\i{}S. hirculus\\i0{} in Denmark. \\par{}\u003e","\u003cThis circumpolar arctic-alpine species differs from \\i{}S. rivularis\\i0{} s.s. in its tiny size, absence of underground stolons and more developed hypanthium. These distinctions, however, are not always well expressed (Zhmylev, in Elven et al. 2003). Jørgensen \u0026 Elven (in Elven et al. 2005) said that \"these distinctions (except for the stolons) are not always obvious, but Jørgensen (2004) and Jørgensen et al. (2006) summarised some additional differences.\"\\par{}Polunin (1940) noted that this plant may penetrate farther into very late-melting snow patches than any other angiosperm. It is frequent almost everywhere, and in places rather abundant, although so small as to be often overlooked. \\par{}Löve and Löve (1975) sorted the diploid counts into two subspecies of \\i{}S. hyperborea\\i0{}: subsp. \\i{}hyperborea\\i0{} in the northern Arctic; and subsp. \\i{}debilis\\i0{} in the broadly Pacific area, including counts around the Bering Strait, in western North America, and also a southern Siberian count (Krogulevich 1971, see above). \\par{}There are two basic diploids (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 26) represented by the amphi-Pacific and amphi-Beringian \\i{}S. bracteata\\i0{} D. Don and the circumpolar and arctic-alpine \\i{}S. hyperborea\\i0{} R. Br. The Cordilleran \\i{}S. flexuosa\\i0{} Sternb. is inseparable from \\i{}S. hyperborea\\i0{} in molecular markers and also nearly inseparable in all studied morphological characters which overlap in every character considered. It probably represents some kind of segregate south of the Cordilleran glaciation but has either survived in or reinvaded the Beringian areas. Transitions between the \\i{}\u0027flexuosa\u0027\\i0{} and \\i{}\u0027hyperborea\u0027\\i0{} morphologies are very abundant in northern Alaska and Yukon. The amphi-Atlantic \\i{}Saxifraga rivularis\\i0{} L. and the now amphi-Beringian \\i{}S. arctolitoralis\\i0{} Jurtz. and V.V.Petrovsky are allotetraploids.\\par{}\u003e","\u003cThis circumpolar arctic-alpine species shows considerable variability of habit, cilia length and hydathode number on the leaves, shape and pubescence of sepals, size and colour of petals. However, the geographical pattern of this morphological polymorphism is not clear. In this connection the majority of botanists accept a broad interpretation of \\i{}S. oppositifolia\\i0{} (Zhmylev, in Elven et al. 2003). \\par{}The variation in \\i{}S. oppositifolia\\i0{} was the basis of a study by Teeri (1972) at Truelove Inlet, Devon Island. He concluded that distinct forms had been named as taxa, which were merely expressions of a single species that shows remarkable vegetatively phenotypic plasticity with little reliable genotypic basis on which to separate infraspecific taxa. \\par{}Brysting et al. (1996) studied the purple saxifrage on Svalbard to determine whether there were two taxa or one. They concluded the conspicuous variation probably results from local, in situ ecoclinal differentiation, which is without taxonomic significance but is important in the context of arctic conservation biology and the potential impact of global warming on Arctic vegetation. \\par{}Boris Yurtsev has suggested that there are two taxa within \\i{}S. oppositifolia\\i0{} in Canada, one with glabrous sepals, the other with glandular hairs on the sepals (personal communication, 1997). In a survey of specimens at CAN plants with glandular sepals there were plants with specimens with densely matted hairs on the sepals, and others with sparse or few hairs. The type specimen of the name \"\\i{}smalliana\\i0{}\" has almost no hairs on the sepals. \\par{}Polunin (1940) considered this to be one of the common species in the Arctic Archipelago and possibly one of the most numerous of all arctic species. It dominates large tracts of country in the Far North, if the ecological term \"dominates\" can be used when the total vegetation is extremely sparse and largely limited to occasional tufts of this one species. He considered it possibly the hardiest of all phanerogams, at least in cold-rigour, occurring on the most exposed ridges and hill tops, often where no other vascular plants can grow. This may be because of the unique structure of the leaves. Elven (personal communication, 2005) noted that this is the northernmost flowering plant in the world, occurring as it does on the off-shore islands north of Greenland. Polunin (1940, p. 268) remarked that \"\\i{}S. oppositifolia\\i0{} ... before and after flowering is among the most squalid-looking of plants, forming untidy brownish mats or tussocks in barren and often dusty situations. When it blooms it must be reckoned among the world\u0027s greatest beauties, especially as it stands out in its usually bleak and desolate surroundings. Unfortunately, few ever see it at its best, which is surely in the Far North, for it is so quickly over that the vast majority of the ever-increasing band of summer visitors to arctic parts come too late.\" \\par{}The internal structure of the leaves led Galloe (1910) to consider this species a xerophyte. The upper epidermal cells have fairly straight lateral walls with numerous pits. Only the part of the leaf that is covered with neighbouring leaves bears stomata, while the light-exposed surface is almost without them. This was regarded as protection against excessive transpiration by Lazniewski (1896). Galloe (1910) considered the distribution of the stomata represented a primitive form of bud-protection in developing leaves in a species where bud scales are absent. \\par{}Gabrielsen et al. (1997) analysed 18 populations of this species from Norway, Svalbard, and Novaya Zemlya, using RAPDs DNA technology, and found more variation in the populations from the High Arctic than further south. Their results suggested that there is more inbreeding towards the north, probably because of lower pollinator activity. \\par{}Gugerli et al. (1999) investigated the genetic variation of \\i{}S. oppositifolia\\i0{} from 10 populations of the Alps in southern Switzerland using RAPDs. They found the genetic variation was mainly within populations (95%), whereas less than 5% was found among populations. They assumed the high outcrossing rate, rare clonal reproductions, and some long-distance dispersal even among topographically separated populations are the crucial determinants for the pattern of genetic variation found in the investigated areas. \\par{}Abbot et al. (2000) examined the chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) restriction site variation among 548 plants sampled from 90 different populations from around the circumpolar and circumboreal area and found 14 cpDNA haplotypes. From their phylogenetic analysis of the cpDNA variation, they suggested that this species first occurred in the Arctic in western Beringia before it migrated east and west to achieve a circumpolar distribution. They suggested that the geographical distribution of cpDNA variation in the species supports the hypothesis that during Pleistocene glaciations, some plant refugia were located in the Arctic as well as at more southern latitudes.\\par{}Aiken et al. (2005) examined growth forms and the presence or absence of hairs on the surfaces of the sepals of plants of \\i{}Saxifraga oppositifolia \\i0{}L., on type specimens and for more than 400 herbarium specimens collected from all over North America and Europe. No morphological differences are associated with three different chromosome numbers known for \\i{}S oppositifolia\\i0{} plants from the area of the North American type specimens, and DNA analyses done mainly on European specimens but also including a potential candidate for the name \\ldblquote{}smalliana\\rdblquote{} gave inconclusive results. Thus, chromosome and DNA data join these morphological data on growth forms and the occurrence of sepal hairs, to discourage recognising subspecies among plants occurring in North America. Aiken et al. (2005) reported that the type specimen of \\i{}S. oppositifolia\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}smalliana \\i0{}(\\i{}S. pulvinata\\i0{}) from the Yukon has compact plants and flowers that have sepal surfaces with a few sparse hairs.\u003e","\u003cWarming (1909) noted that the leaves after dying persist for a long time in a black, decaying condition. In northern Europe, this species belongs to a complex in which polymorphic entities have been recorded (Engler and Irmscher 1919). Polunin (1940) suggested that in the Arctic Archipelago it appears to vary very little. \\par{}Galloe (1910) noted that each tooth of the leaves has a vein that terminates in a hydathode with a large cavity. The epidermis of the hydathode has 1-2 water pores, and some of the cells are elongated as papillae. In many of the cells of the mesophyll there are quantities of tanin. \\par{}Zhmylev in Elven et al. (2003) noted this \"Amphi-Atlantic, arctic-alpine, polymorphic species is widely distributed in the mountains of western and central Europe. Arctic plants differ from the typical race (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 28) in having longer different testa papillae and thicker raphe, marking the place of capsule dehiscence. American botanists have regarded arctic plants as \\i{}S. paniculata\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}neogaea\\i0{} (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 28). The variability of \\i{}S. paniculata\\i0{}, however, is fairly large, so that the differences may not have any taxonomic value.\" \\par{}There is a discrepancy between Löve and Löve (1975), which included Iceland and Greenland plants in subsp. \\i{}neogaea\\i0{}, and Hultén and Fries (1986), which restricted subsp. \\i{}neogaea\\i0{} to Canada and U.S.A. (Elven in Elven et al. 2003).\u003e","\u003cThis species is sometimes recognised as \\i{}Saxifraga flagellaris\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}platysepala\\i0{} (Porsild 1964, Porsild and Cody 1980). \\par{}Porsild and Cody (1980) recognised: \\par{}1. \\b\\i{}Saxifraga flagellaris\\b0{} \\i0{}subsp. \\b\\i{}flagellaris\\b0\\i0{}: in which the hypanthium is broadly campanulate (bell-shaped) and green. It is of Amphi-Beringian range, and known only from calcareous rocks along the east slopes of the Mackenzie and Richardson Mountains. \\par{}2. \\b\\i{}S. flagellaris\\b0{} \\i0{}subsp. \\b\\i{}platysepala\\b0\\i0{} (Trautv.) Porsild: is a High Arctic and nearly circumpolar taxon. It is mostly 1-flowered, with a turbinate (top-like), rather than campanulate hypanthium with dark purple sepals that are obovate-oblong, united in the lower third, and covered by stalked, purple-headed glands. They indicated that this taxon has not been reported from the continent. Polunin (1940) commented that although the species as a whole is very variable he had not been able to find marked taxa within the Canadian Arctic.\\par{}The geographic separation of the subspecies recognised in Porsild and Cody (1980) and the strength of distinct characters are regarded as sufficient to justify recognising the taxon as a distinct species. However, Porsild and Cody\u0027s (1980) subsp. \\i{}flagellaris\\i0{} is \\i{}Saxifraga setigera\\i0{} Pursh (or \\i{}S. flagellaris\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}setigera\\i0{} (Pursh) Tolm.). Willdenow\u0027s \\i{}S. flagellaris\\i0{} s. str. is probably restricted to the Caucasus (Elven, 2005, personal communication).\\par{}Galloe (1910), discussing the fleshy leaves of \\i{}S. flagellaris\\i0{}, suggested there are three features that appear to be useless rudiments inherited from parent plants with foliage leaves similar in structure to those of the present-day \\i{}S. flagellaris\\i0{}. These are (a) functionless (permanently closed) stomata, (b) functionless hydathodes (in which the water pores are closed), and (c) light-orientated (obliquely placed) palisade cells. \\par{}Polunin (1940, p. 264) noted that \"this extremely attractive high-arctic and alpine species, was known to the old sailors and whalers as \u0027spider plant\u0027 on account of its round \u0027body\u0027 and long, leg-like \u0027flagellae\u0027 subtending daughter individuals\". He reported curious contradictions with regard to substrate pH relationships. Scholander (1934) says that it is \"fairly common in North-East Land, (Greenland) except in the pure dolomite areas, where it is almost lacking\". Gelting (1934) wrote, \"as I have not found the species outside soil rich in lime, I consider it calciphilous\". Polunin (1940) stated that he had never found it on soils that were at all highly calcareous either in Spitsbergen or in Arctic America, but always in rather exposed barren situations where the soil was nevertheless lastingly damp, owing to poor drainage or occasionally to feeding from a long-lasting snowdrift. Polunin\u0027s observations are true for plants found growing beside the road to \"Satellite hill\" near Resolute Bay, Cornwallis Island.\u003e","\u003cPolunin (1940) indicated that this is one of the most ubiquitous and generally common of arctic plants. At that time he included \\i{}S. hyperborea\\i0{} in \\i{}S. rivularis\\i0{}, and almost all his statements refer to the former rather than the latter.\\par{}This is an Amphi-Atlantic arctic species that previously included \\i{}S. hyperborea\\i0{}. \"At present, only plants with stolons and 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 52 are attributed to \\i{}S. rivularis\\i0{}. However, the [distinctiveness of the growth forms] and other morphological distinctions between \\i{}S. rivularis\\i0{} and \\i{}S. hyperborea\\i0{} are not always obvious\" (Zhmylev in Elven et al. 2003), and the problem was studied by Jørgensen (2004).\\par{}Jørgensen (2004), in a thesis done at Oslo (with Elven, R., Stedje, B., Gabrielsen, T.M., and Brochmann, C.), studied reticulate evolution and species delimitation in the arctic \\i{}Saxifraga rivularis\\i0{} complex and found there is a very good correspondence between molecular genetic evidence, chromosome ploidy evidence, and morphological evidence for the structure they proposed in the \\i{}Saxifraga rivularis\\i0{} group.\\par{}The amphi-Atlantic \\i{}Saxifraga rivularis\\i0{} L. subsp. \\i{}rivularis\\i0{} and the now amphi-Beringian \\i{}S. rivularis \\i0{}subsp.\\i{} arctolitoralis\\i0{} (Jurtzev \u0026 Petrovsky) M.H.Jørg. \u0026 Elven are allotetraploids, and they have a common parentage from one or more crossed between \\i{}S. bracteata\\i0{} and \\i{}S. hyperborea\\i0{}. The origin is therefore suspected to be Beringian. However, there is a vast gap between the ranges of these two subspecies, also associated with some small morphological differences and some slight molecular differences. It is therefore appropriate to recognise them as two subspecies, but not as two species. \\par{}A survey of the Alaska and Yukon material (in ALA) proved \\i{}S. rivularis\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}arctolitoralis\\i0{} to be fairly common in NW and N Alaska. It reaches close to the Canadian border but has not yet been found in Canada.\u003e","\u003cThe northernmost record, and first collection from the Arctic Archipelago, is from Melville Island, Sabine Peninsula, Barrow Dome, 76°38\u0027N, 109°05\u0027W, 21 July 1971, \\i{}M. Kuc 157\\i0{} (Canada). There have been three other collections from different places on Melville Island. This tiny plant is easily overlooked and is probably under-collected. Plants found in Canada belong to subsp. \\i{}serpyllifolia\\i0{}. It is an Amphi-Beringian mainly arctic subspecies with glabrous leaves on the vegetative shoots and yellow flowers. Transitional forms to subsp. \\i{}glandulosa\\i0{}, with slightly pubescent leaves on the vegetative shoots, can be found rarely in the lower reaches of the Lena river and in the southern regions of the Siberian part of the area (Zhmylev, in Elven et al. 2003).\u003e","\u003cGalloe (1910) considered this species a xerophyte based on the habitats where it grows and the internal anatomy of leaves. \\par{}This species is not known outside of North America and Greenland. Polunin (1940) stated that \"the vast majority of the specimens from the Canadian Arctic Archipelago have the leaves tricuspidate, and so belong to the typical form. Some however, especially when growing in exposed habitats, have most of their leaves lacking these conspicuous lateral teeth, and a few from widely separate places have all the leaves sub-entire\". Polunin (1938) recognised a forma \\i{}subintegrifolia\\i0{} (Abrom.) Polunin, but this was not taken up by Porsild (1957). \\par{}Polunin (1940, p. 263) stated that \"\\i{}S. tricuspidata\\i0{} varies little in our area, except in luxuriance. Thus the axes may sometimes be only 5 cm high, although generally they rise to double this height and sometimes exceed 15 cm. Such luxuriant specimens growing in the most favourable situations may form extensive mats, especially in the south. The plant generally looks reddish, but in damp and shaded crevices there occur lengthened green forms, which are usually sterile\". No reason for maintaining the forma recognised by Polunin (1940) has been found.\u003e","\u003cMosquin (1971) made a very good case for recognition of two subspecies, one widespread (subsp. \\i{}lewisii\\i0{}) and one restricted to the Hudson and James Bay shores (subsp. \\i{}lepagei\\i0{}). The plants collected in the Arctic Archipelago are subsp. \\i{}lewisii\\i0{}. One collection is from the site of a Rough-legged Hawk (\\i{}Buteo lagopus\\i0{}) nest, suggesting that it was accidentally introduced to the area by birds.\\par{}Kikuchi (1929) reported on the difference of chromosome numbers in \\i{}Linum\\i0{} species.\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Salix alaxensis \\i0{}is one of the tallest growing willows in the Arctic Archipelago.

It occurs in northern Ungava (Maycock 1963), but evidently it has not been able to cross the Hudson Straits to Baffin Island.\u003e","\u003cThis circumpolar species is morphologically polymorphic and nomenclaturally confused. Many botanists studying the flora of the Arctic Archipelago have collected what they thought were two or three species of \\i{}Salix\\i0{} only to find on their return that they were all \\i{}S. arctica\\i0{}. Some taxonomists (Hultén 1967, 1971) have recognised three subspecies in \\i{}S. arctica\\i0{}: (1) subsp. \\i{}arctica\\i0{} (circumpolar from Iceland and the Faeroe Islands across northern Russia, Alaska, and Canada to Greenland, south to the Hudson Bay shores of Ontario and the Gasp\\u8218\\\u002782 Peninsula), (2) subsp. \\i{}crassijulis\\i0{} (a North Pacific race ranging from Kamchatka and the Russian Far East to the Aleutian Islands, south central and southeastern Alaska along the coast to northern Washington), and (3) subsp. \\i{}torulosa\\i0{} (ranging from the mountains of Central Asia to Kamchatka and the Bering Straits, the Brooks Range and the Rocky Mountains in Alaska, south in the cordillera to southern British Columbia and Alberta). While the phytogeographic pattern of these three races is appealing, they are actually very difficult or impossible to separate morphologically. Argus (1973) presented evidence that the latter two subspecies were environmental modifications of one species. He reported that robust plants in the Glacier Bay area of southeastern Alaska (\\i{}S. arctica\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}crassijulis\\i0{}) were associated with nitrogen-rich \\i{}Alnus\\i0{} thickets, whereas small plants (\\i{}S. arctica\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}torulosa\\i0{}) from the same area were growing on open moraine. Others have also reported environmental modification of \\i{}S. arctica\\i0{}. Savile (1964) noted that depauperate specimens occurred in depressions behind beach ridges where they may be immersed in years of high water. Soper and Powell (1985) observed that this species varied considerably according to ecological and edaphic conditions. Dawson (1987) showed that the female-biased sex ratios in \\i{}S. arctica\\i0{} are environmentally controlled. He found that female plants are significantly over-represented in mesic-wet, more fertile, low soil temperature sites, whereas male plants are predominant in drier, less fertile sites. In light of this evidence, the possibility that the complex morphological variability within \\i{}S. arctica\\i0{} may be ecophenic or ecotypic deserves study. Other characters cited to separate subsp. \\i{}torulosa\\i0{} (Hultén 1971), including leaf shape and floral bract colour, do not withstand scrutiny (Argus 1973, Raup 1959). The morphological variability within \\i{}S. arctica\\i0{}, although striking, does not seem to reflect taxonomic differences. \\par{}Specimens of \\i{}Salix arctica\\i0{} of various ages have been reported in the arctic. Gelting (1934) found a specimen of about 130 years in Franz Joseph Fjord, East Greenland. In the Mesters Vig area of East Greenland (King Oscars Fjord), Raup (1965) reported that most specimens were about 60 years old, with one reaching 180 years and another 236 years. Savile (1979) reported the oldest Canadian material, 85 years, from Lake Hazen, Ellesmere Island (Savile 1979). \\par{}In northern Greenland, \\i{}Salix arctica\\i0{} is one of the primary foods for muskox, arctic hare, and collared lemming (Klein and Bay 1991). \\par{}\\b{}Hybrids\\b0{} \\par{}\\i{}Salix arctica\\i0{} × \\i{}S. arctophila\\i0{} (\\i{}S\\i0{}. ×\\i{}hudsonensis \\i0{}C.

The leaves are usually broad to sub-circular, the margins are usually minutely toothed, the stipules are small and usually ovate, the catkins are sessile, the ovaries are glabrous, and the stipes and styles long. \\par{}This species has been treated as \\i{}S. lanata\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}calcicola\\i0{} (Hultén 1968). Subspecies rank was proposed because the two taxa were thought to intergrade where their ranges overlap in the eastern Arctic. The intergradation, however, is not clear, and hybridisation between \\i{}S. calcicola\\i0{} and \\i{}S. richardsonii\\i0{} is not proved. This situation is very similar to that found in \\i{}S. lanata\\i0{} - \\i{}S\\i0{}. \\i{}richardsonii, S. lanata \\i0{}-\\i{} S. calcicola\\i0{}, and \\i{}S. brachycarpa\\i0{} - \\i{}S. niphoclada\\i0{}. Trinomial nomenclature, in all of these cases, was used to show the close evolutionary relationship between these taxa. But inasmuch as such nomenclature is cumbersome to use and is therefore often ignored by the non-taxonomist, its information value is minimal. In addition, the evidence of intergradation is often indistinct or non-existent, suggesting that the use of binomial nomenclature may be more appropriate. \\par{}\\b{}Hybrids\\b0{} \\par{}\\i{}Salix calcicola\\i0{} × \\i{}S. richardsonii\\i0{}.

He claimed to have seen some suggestion of hybridisation between \\i{}S. calcicola\\i0{} and \\i{}S. richardsonii\\i0{} on Southampton Island, but no clear evidence of hybridisation elsewhere. This problem requires field study.\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Salix fuscescens\\i0{} is known in the Arctic islands only on Victoria Island, where it was collected at Long Lake by J.D.H.

Böcher (1952) noted two ecologically and morphologically different types of \\i{}Salix glauca\\i0{} occurring in West Greenland. A smooth one corresponding to \\i{}S. cordifolia\\i0{} var. \\i{}callicarpaea\\i0{} and an hirsute one corresponding to \\i{}S. cordifolia\\i0{} var. \\i{}intonsa\\i0{}. Argus (1965) proposed that all Greenland material belonged to \\i{}S. glauca\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}callicarpaea\\i0{} (as the Eastern Phase of \\i{}S. glauca\\i0{}). Böcher later recognised them as two subspecies, \\i{}S. glauca\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}callicarpaea\\i0{} (including var. \\i{}intonsa\\i0{}) and \\i{}S. glauca\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}glauca\\i0{}, which he thought resembled the European \\i{}S. glauca\\i0{} (Böcher et al. 1968). Skvortsov (1971) agreed with Argus that European \\i{}S. glauca\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}glauca\\i0{} did not occur on Greenland. He pointed out that it differed in the following characters: generally shorter, broader, more obtuse leaves; adaxial leaf surface bare and even somewhat shiny; flowering branchlets as long as the catkins themselves (European plants are usually shorter); bracts often brownish; stamens with glabrous filaments (more common than in European plants); and a more spreading growth form. \\par{}Subspecies \\i{}callicarpaea\\i0{} extends across Canada, south to northern Saskatchewan and Manitoba, and east to Newfoundland and Greenland.

It is sometimes difficult to separate from \\i{}S. richardsonii\\i0{} based on vegetative material. The two overlap on Banks Island, but they are easily separated by the silky ovaries of \\i{}Salix pulchra\\i0{} and the glabrous ovaries of \\i{}S. richardsonii\\i0{}. \\par{}This species has been treated as \\i{}S. planifolia\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}pulchra\\i0{} (Argus 1973). Subspecies rank was proposed because the two taxa appeared to intergrade where their ranges overlap in the Mackenzie Mountains and in northwestern British Columbia.

Leaves are usually broad to circular-elliptic, with an adaxial surface that is prominently reticulate with impressed venation. Catkins are borne on flowering branchlets that are indistinguishable from normal vegetative branchlets; some plants have almost all branchlets ending in a catkin. When the leaves of this species emerge in the spring, they are covered with fine white hairs. These interrupt the flow of cold air across the surface of the leaf yet permit sunlight to enter, creating a miniature greenhouse in which the sun can raise the temperature of the surface of the plant several degrees above the surrounding temperature (Savile 1972). This allows the leaf to begin photosynthesising under colder conditions.\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Salix richardsonii\\i0{} is a shrubby species with persistent, prominent, slender stipules with a long attenuate tip and a broader, inequilateral base. Catkins are sessile or with a few green bracts at the base. The ovaries are glabrous, and the nectaries 2-3 times as long as the stipes. It is similar to \\i{}S. pulchra\\i0{}, but because the latter species is known in our area only on Banks Island, their separation will not often pose a problem. On Banks Island, the two species are easily separated by the hairiness of their ovaries.\\par{}This species is often treated as \\i{}S. lanata\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}richardsonii\\i0{} (Argus 1973, Skvortsov 1968). Subspecies rank was proposed by Skvortsov because the two taxa apparently intergrade where their ranges overlap in the Ural Mountains, Russia (Skvortsov 1968, 1999). The intergradation, however, does not seem to extend beyond the overlapping populations.

I have decided to treat these taxa as distinct species because the area of overlap between them is relatively small, and because the use of trinomial nomenclature in taxa with widely separated ranges is unnecessarily cumbersome. \\par{}Polunin (1940) described \\i{}S. richardsonii\\i0{} var. \\i{}mckeandii\\i0{} as differing from the species in having smaller leaves [1-3 (4) cm long and 0.4-1.3 (1.5) cm wide] and capsules borne on short, hairy stipes. The type, which is in the British Museum, and the specimens he cites (1940: 169) require study.

The only known collections (in the British Museum) were made by Nicholas Polunin in about 1933 (Polunin 1934).\u003e","\u003cBarneby (1964) recognised this species as being in the section \\i{}Astragalus\\i0{}. He stated that \\ldblquote{}the alpine milk-vetch is the most widely dispersed of all astagali, yet when due allowance has been made for the diversity of soils, climates, and environments to which it has become adapted, it is a comparatively little variable species.\\rdblquote{} He recognised two varieties as occurring in North America. The arctic plants are \\i{}A. alpinus\\i0{} var. \\i{}alpinus\\i0{}. A second variety, \\i{}A. alpinus\\i0{} var. \\i{}brunetianus\\i0{}, occurs on river and lake shores in New England, Newfoundland, and southeastern Quebec. \\par{}Barneby (1964) discussed another variant of \\i{}A. alpinus\\i0{}, \"... confined to the highest latitudes around the pole, that has been described as \\i{}A. arcticus\\i0{} Bunge.\" It was maintained by Gontscharov (1946), as a distinct species under the epithet \\i{}subpolaris\\i0{}, and recognised by Hultén (1944) as a subspecies coordinate with subsp. \\i{}alaskanus\\i0{}.

Porsild (1964) identified the Arctic taxon as \\i{}A. richardsonii\\i0{} Sheldon and indicated the species is closely related to the prairie species \\i{}A. aboriginum\\i0{} Richardson from which it differs in having large flowers, glabrous legumes, and more densely tomentose leaves. \\par{}Barneby (1964) stated that \\ldblquote{}because of the variations in stature, vestiture, and amplitude of the foliage, the Indian milk-vetch, \\i{}A. aboriginum\\i0{}, cannot be characterised in a few succinct words\\rdblquote{}. He placed \\i{}A. richardsonii\\i0{} in synonymy under \\i{}A. aboriginum\\i0{} because of the large, prominently veined, obtuse stipules at base of the stems and the toothed wing petals.\\par{}Barneby (1964) also noted that \"the Arctic and sub-arctic races of \\i{}A. aboriginum\\i0{} introduce three new features, petioled stem leaves, larger flowers, and broader pods than found in the Rocky Mountains.\" Barneby (1964) was not willing to equate \\i{}A. aboriginum\\i0{} with the circumpolar \\i{}A. australis\\i0{} (also the earlier name), however. This step was left to Welsh (1991). \\par{}Murray and Elven (personal communication, 2005) noted that this section, or alternatively as the \\i{}A. australis\\i0{} aggregate, is perhaps the most controversial group of arctic \\i{}Astragalus\\i0{}. The opinions differ strongly, both in general and among the collaborators on the Panarctic Flora Checklist (Elven et al. 2003). No consensus has been arrived at. It is one case, among many, of very widespread Eurasiatic and North American taxa with several allopatric to parapatric, morphologically distinguishable entities in different mountains and tundras. Such cases have been treated very differently in different families and by various authors. We are here treating \\i{}A. aboriginum\\i0{} and \\i{}A. richardsonii\\i0{} under \\i{}A. australis\\i0{} (following Welsh 1991), pending further study in this group. \\par{}\\i{}Astragalus australis\\i0{} was one of the taxa considered by Liston (1992) in a study of the variation in the chloroplast genes RPOC1 and RCOP2 of the genus.\u003e","\u003cBarneby (1964) recognised this taxon as being in section \\i{}Oroboidei\\i0{}. A similar species, \\i{}A. robbinsii\\i0{} (Oakes) Gray, grows in central and southern Yukon and southern Alaska. Barneby (1964) considered the elegant milk-vetch \\i{}A. eucosmus\\i0{} to be closely related to \\i{}A. robbinsii\\i0{}, differing chiefly in the sessile pod. The leaflets tend to be narrower and the flowers are often smaller, but neither of these features is diagnostic of \\i{}A. eucosmus\\i0{}, and fruits, at least half-formed, are often necessary for identification. Despite its great range, \\i{}A. eucosmus\\i0{} is only moderately variable, much less so than a glance at the synonymy might suggest. Normally an erect plant of moderate stature, it is susceptible to dwarfing in open montane and far northern environments, where the stems become diffuse or weakly ascending as well as shorter, and the raceme tends to become shorter and more compact in fruit. The raceme of \\i{}A. eucosmus\\i0{} ordinarily elongates rapidly during anthesis, the axis becoming about 3.5-19 cm long in fruit, with pods well spaced along its length. Instances of shorter fruit are correlated with short diffuse stems and an unfavourable habitat, mostly on exposed seashores at high latitudes in eastern Canada and Baffin. \\par{}Elven et al (2005) noted that \"Scoggan (1978) synonymised \\i{}A. sealei\\i0{} with \\i{}A. eucosmus\\i0{} f. \\i{}eucosmus\\i0{} (one of four formae). Gillett et al. (1999) also fully included \\i{}A. sealei\\i0{} in \\i{}A. eucosmus\\i0{}. Hultén (1968b and elsewhere) treated the entities \\i{}\u0027eucosmus\u0027\\i0{} and \\i{}\u0027sealei\u0027\\i0{} as subspecies but commented on the similarity between \\i{}\u0027sealei\u0027\\i0{} and the Eurasian \\i{}A. norvegicus\\i0{}. Yurtsev (in Elven et al. 2003) treated all three entities as species. Murray and Elven [personal communication, 2005] compared material of all three taxa and share[d] Yurtsev\u0027s opinion.

An alternative might be to assign \\i{}\u0027sealei\u0027\\i0{} as a subspecies to \\i{}A. norvegicus\\i0{}, but we are not aware of such a combination.\"\u003e","\u003cA relatively well-defined single entity in the Arctic Archipelago. Yurtsev (Sept 2001) considered that \\i{}Hedysarum alpinum\\i0{} and \\i{}H. americanum\\i0{} are species-level distinct. \"They cannot be considered as vicarious taxa due to an enormous gap between their ranges (several thousand km!) (this gap is just within the Russian Far-East). There are constant distinctions between \\i{}H. alpinum\\i0{} and \\i{}H. americanum\\i0{}, e.g., in shape of leaflets and their termination, length of mucrone - brevissime versus elongate, form of bracts and their length in relation to that of pedicels (shorter versus somewhat longer in \\i{}H. americanum\\i0{}), the characters of pubescence of inflorescence, form of calyx teeth (triangular versus triangular-lanceolate). Despite similarity of morphotype, they are different in characters for nearly all organs and thus should not be considered as conspecific\" (Yurtsev, Sept. 2001).\\par{}The current North American opinion (Gillett et al. 1999 onwards) has been to accept a widely defined \\i{}H. alpinum\\i0{} and even to include the more arctic parts of the North American range in a var. \\i{}alpinum\\i0{} described from Siberia (Linnaeus 1753), with an unnamed variety (beta) in the Alps. \\par{}Elven et al. (2003) suggested that the solution may be \"to accept a widely defined \\i{}H. alpinum\\i0{} with 2-3 subspecies: subsp. \\i{}alpinum\\i0{} (perhaps not arctic, perhaps including \\i{}\u0027vicioides\u0027\\i0{} and then arctic), subsp. \\i{}vicioides\\i0{}, and subsp. \\i{}americanum\\i0{} (including all the North American plants).\" Hultén (1968) was of the opinion that the Asiatic plants were subsp. \\i{}alpinum\\i0{}, the North American ones subsp. \\i{}americanum\\i0{}. His opinion was that all the Siberian plants belonged in subsp. \\i{}alpinum \\i0{}s.s., that is, also the \\i{}\u0027vicioides\u0027\\i0{} entity. (Yurtsev (personal communication Sept. 2001) considered that \\i{}H. vicioides\\i0{} is a very good species slightly reaching the Arctic in the lower reaches of the Lena River, with very small yellowish white flowers, bracts and calyx glabrous, ciliate, pubescent in lower half. Rhizomes are lacking, roots tuberose. It can hardly be included into any aggregate). \\par{}Porsild and Cody (1980) commented that in North America, \\ldblquote{}the transitional differences between the arctic and more temperate plants appear to be quite gradual and to be merely an expression of climatic differences\\rdblquote{}, therefore also agreeing on a single North American taxon. \\par{}We treat the taxon \\i{}H. americanum\\i0{} at species level, following the current treatment in the Panarctic Flora Project, recognising that the authors of the PAF project agree that it is still unresolved whether the taxa are sufficiently different to warrant species status.\\par{}We have found no Arctic Island specimens with the fruiting stages collected.

There are two other subspecies occurring in southern British Columbia and south into Washington. In the Arctic islands, the Arctic lupin is usually found on well-drained hummocks in the tundra, but it has occasionally been collected in sedge meadows. Further south, near the Arctic Circle, it is found in forest clearings. \\i{}Lupinus arcticus\\i0{} is closely related to \\i{}L. perennis\\i0{} L. \\par{}Majak et al.

According to investigations of Jorgensen (2001) and Jorgensen et al. (2003), this typical subspecies is purple-flowered and appears to be distributed in Canada and northern Alaska.

(2003) reported a major discussion on the \\i{}Oxytropis nigrescens\\i0{} aggregate (\\i{}O. nigrescens\\i0{}, \\i{}O. pumilio\\i0{}, ?\\i{}O.sublongipes\\i0{}). They noted that this aggregate was proposed as 8-9 separate species in Yurtsev\u0027s draft for Elven et al. (2003). The North American view is to consider the entire American part of the aggregate as one variable species with \u0027varieties\u0027 (Barneby 1952, later taken up by Gillett et al. 1999 onwards). As the varieties mostly occupy different regions, they would more naturally be subspecies in the Panarctic Checklist concept (Elven et al. 2003). This is also supported by the ranges of the major entities: \\i{}nigrescens\\i0{} s.s. from Jenisei to Kolyma, \u0027\\i{}czukotica\u0027 \\i0{}from Kolyma to the Bering Strait, \u0027\\i{}pygmaea\\i0\\rquote{} (\u0027\\i{}gorodkovii\\i0\\rquote{}) around the Bering Strait, \u0027\\i{}bryophila\\i0\\rquote{} in Alaska-Yukon, and \u0027\\i{}arctobia\\i0\\rquote{} in northern Canada. They are all diploid or tetraploid, parapatric, and closely related. Because the nomenclatural conclusions are still not completely resolved, we are using the specific rank for the Canadian entity \u0027arctobia\u0027, following Yurtsev\u0027s draft for Elven et al. (2003). \\par{}Polunin (1940) noted that there is a specimen of this species in the Gray Herbarium among a collection that has often been referred to as coming from Melville Island, but actually was made far to the southeast during Parry\\rquote{}s second voyage. He indicated that the Arctic Bay material differs from all other specimens that he had examined in having seeds that are light brown instead of almost black when ripe, and having the insides of the pods essentially glabrous instead of flocculent-pubescent. The pubescence on the outside also tends to be less dense and spreading. On these characters he recognised \\i{}O. arctobia\\i0{} var. \\i{}hyperarctica \\i0{}Polunin. This name and the recognition of this taxon has not been widely taken up. \\par{}\u003e","\u003cElven et al. (2003) treat \\i{}Oxytropis borealis\\i0{} as \\i{}O. glutinosa\\i0{} A.E. Porsild and noted the pattern in North America might justify four regional races: \\i{}\u0027borealis\u0027\\i0{} as amphi-Beringian and Alaskan, \\i{}\u0027glutinosa\u0027\\i0{} as northwestern Canadian, \\i{}\u0027viscida\u0027\\i0{} as Cordilleran, and \\i{}\u0027hudsonica\u0027\\i0{} as central-northeastern Canadian (\u0027Hudsonian\u0027). An alternative would be to merge \\i{}\u0027borealis\u0027\\i0{} and \\i{}\u0027glutinosa\u0027\\i0{} within one subspecies. Because the combinations for subspecies of these taxa are not yet available, here we use the species names \\i{}O. borealis\\i0{} for the western taxon (as this will be the name published in \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{}) and \\i{}O. hudsonica \\i0{}for this taxon of the Hudsonian region, until a classification is clarified which satisfies the circumpolar morphological discontinuities, available chromosome evidence, and any future molecular evidence.\\par{}Welsh (1990) considered that \\i{}O. borealis\\i0{} in North America consists of an intergrading series of varieties. This whole species complex has fragrant viscid herbage, and was treated as \\i{}O. viscida\\i0{} by Barneby (1952), but \\i{}O. borealis\\i0{} is the earliest name in North America (Welsh 1990). In the Canadian Arctic Islands, plants are generally recognisable as belonging to two varieties. \\par{}Specimens from Banks Island most closely resemble \\i{}O.\\i0{} \\i{}borealis\\i0{}. These plants have calyx teeth that are 2 mm or longer, and possess copious glandular verrucae; the calyces are copiously black hairy. In dried specimens the glands can become less noticeable, but the glandular verrucae on the calyx lobes remain prominent (Barneby 1952, p 239). However, some of the Banks Island specimens approach the more southern \\i{}var. viscida\\i0{} in that although the leaves generally have 25 leaflets or fewer, some specimens have more leaflets. The distinction between var. \\i{}borealis\\i0{} and var. \\i{}viscida\\i0{} is sometimes not possible (Barneby 1952), especially when the plant is in flower, but Barneby gives arguments for recognising the more northern ones as var. \\i{}borealis\\i0{}. Banks Island specimens have been identified by S.L. Welsh (in 1998), but the distinction between these two varieties requires further study (S.L. Welsh, personal communication, 1999). \\par{}The taxon recognised by Porsild\u0027s (1957) as \\i{}O. glutinosa\\i0{} was synonymised under \\i{}O. borealis\\i0{} var. \\i{}viscida\\i0{}, but as Welsh (1990) stated,\" var. \\i{}borealis\\i0{} consists, at least in part, of what has passed under the name of \\i{}O. glutinosa\\i0{} Porsild\".\u003e","\u003cPorsild (1964) recognised this taxon as \\i{}O. foliolosa\\i0{} Hooker. Barneby (1952), followed by Welsh (1991), treated it as \\i{}O. deflexa\\i0{} var. \\i{}foliolosa\\i0{}, which Cody (1994) changed to subspecies status. Cronquist et al. (1989) and Isely (1998) have since synonymised var. \\i{}foliolosa\\i0{} under var. \\i{}deflexa\\i0{}.\\par{}The Iqaluit distribution records are new since Porsild (1957). One site is near the airport, another near Arctic College. Is it possible that the Iqaluit records were accidentally introduced from Kimmirut (Lake Harbour)? Porsild (1957) mapped a collection from the coast of midwestern Baffin Island, but the specimen has not been found.\u003e","\u003cElven et al.

Porsild separated these as follows: \\par{}Calyx lobes deltoid, one-quarter to one-third as long as the tube...\\i{}O. hudsonica\\i0\\par{}Calyx lobes subulate, one-half to two-thirds as long as the tube....\\i{}O. glutinosa \\i0{}[\u003d \\i{}O. borealis\\i0{}]\\par{}In the east, and on Southampton Island, \\i{}O. hudsonica\\i0{} is recognised by having calyx teeth less than 2 mm long and lacking glandular verrucae.

(2005). These authors considered that subsp. \\i{}maydelliana\\i0{} is the amphi-Beringian subspecies that occurs east to Mackenzie River, while subsp. \\i{}melanocephala\\i0{} is North American and occurs from Mackenzie eastwards. Intermediates occur in the Mackenzie River area, but that is to be expected among subspecies. The main diagnostic character used to distinguish the subspecies, inflorescence indumentum, seems to hold.\u003e","\u003cPorsild (1964) mapped records for Kimmirut and Cape Dorset, but we have found no vouchers to confirm the distributions.\u003e","\u003cThis entity was treated as \\i{}O. campestris\\i0{} var. \\i{}terrae-novae\\i0{} by Barneby (1952) and for priority reasons as \\i{}O. campestris\\i0{} var. \\i{}minor\\i0{} by Gillett et al. (1999 onwards). It is a major entity in northeastern North America and is in the framework or the Panarctic Flora checklist either as a subspecies or a species. The North American plants treated as varieties of \\i{}O. campestris\\i0{} (last century) differ much more morphologically from each other and from \\i{}O. campestris\\i0{} s.s. than do the European subspecies and some of the Russian species. For this reason the North American plants are treated as a species distinct from European \\i{}O. campestris.\\i0{}\u003e","\u003cElisens and Packer (1980) considered the \\i{}O. campestris\\i0{} complex in northwestern North America a polyploid series comprising at least seven morphologically and geographically distinct taxa. They recognised \\i{}O. varians\\i0{} as having hexaploid and decaploid representatives but did not attempt to divide the taxa, as no differences were observed between them with the exception of guard cell size. Elven (personal communication, 2005) noted that the following ploidy levels are reported within \\i{}O. varians\\i0{}: 2\\i{}x\\i0{}, 4\\i{}x\\i0{}, 6\\i{}x\\i0{}, 8\\i{}x\\i0{}, 12\\i{}x\\i0{}, all of them on quite reliably identified material. This is obviously a complex \u0027species\u0027.\\par{}\\i{}Oxytropis hyperborea\\i0{} is now synonymised with \\i{}O. varians\\i0{} or, if it is considered to be a subspecies or variety, with \\i{}O. campestris\\i0{} subsp./var. \\i{}varians\\i0{} by almost all current North American authors, e.g., Cody (1996), Gillett et al. (1999 onwards).\u003e","\u003cFurlow (1997) stated that \\i{}B. glandulosa\\i0{} is the characteristic dwarf birch of upland habitats throughout the west, occurring as well in dry open areas across the north. In parts of Alaska and near Churchill, Manitoba, where the ranges of these species overlap, \\i{}B. glandulosa\\i0{} integrates with \\i{}B. nana\\i0{}, forming a confusing complex of intermediate forms with plants intermediate between \\i{}B. glandulosa\\i0{} and \\i{}B. nana\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}exilis\\i0{}. Whenever they remain in isolation, the species remain reasonably distinct and easy to identify. In southern Greenland, \\i{}B. glandulosa\\i0{} hybridises with \\i{}B. nana\\i0{} and with \\i{}B. pubescens\\i0{}.\\par{}Jacobs et al. (1985) described pollen deposition and the distribution of \\i{}Betula glandulosa\\i0{} at the limit of Low Arctic tundra in southern Baffin Island.\u003e","\u003cFurlow (1997) distinguishes subsp. \\i{}nana\\i0{} as having young pubescent twigs, not covered with a conspicuous resinous layer. This is the taxon that occurs in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Plant with twigs glabrous or only puberulent, and covered with a thick resinous coating, are \\i{}B. nana\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}exilis\\i0{} (Sukaczev) Hultén. This subspecies occurs in the Yukon, Alaska, and Northern Asia. \\par{}\\i{}Betula nana\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}nana\\i0{} occurs in both eastern and western Greenland at latitudes north of 63°N. In northern Europe, the range of this subspecies extends across the subarctic zone and southward in the Alps and other ranges. \\par{}There seems to be some agreement that there are three major geographic races, the very widely amphi-Atlantic subsp. \\i{}nana\\i0{}, the Russian-Siberian subsp. \\i{}tundrarum\\i0{}, and the widely amphi-Beringian subsp. \\i{}exilis\\i0{} (Elven et al. 2003).\u003e","\u003cHebda and Chinnappa (1990) reported that the pollen of this taxon is produced in monads that are isopolar, radially symmetrical, and tetracolporate, and they described the pollen in detail. \\par{}Chambers et al. (1990) observed the effects of disturbance type on seedling environment and establishment of alpine species with different physiological and life history traits during a 2-year study on the Beartooth Plateau in southwestern Montana, USA. They compared soil temperatures, water potentials, and nutrients on mineral soils of a gravel borrow area with those on highly organic soils of a \\i{}Acomastylis (Geum)\\i0{} turf area. They concluded that successful seedling establishment on different alpine disturbance types may depend more on obtaining the necessary conditions for seedling emergence and on species interactions than on the ability of seedlings to survive different environmental conditions. \\par{}Chambers (1991) studied the relationships of clone area and neighbourhood to ramet size, reproductive effort, and spatial distribution within \\i{}A. rossii\\i0{} clones in an alpine ecosystem on the Beartooth Plateau, Montana, USA. Conservative patterns of growth and reproduction make \\i{}A. rossii\\i0{} well suited to dominate in dense, heterogeneous neighbourhoods of late seral sites and to colonise mineral soils of early seral sites. Similar to other clonal species, site characteristics and the type of neighbourhood determine the trade-off between the physical occupation of space and the allocation to ramet growth and reproduction in \\i{}A. rossii\\i0{}.\u003e","\u003cElven et al. (2003) suggested that if \\i{}Dasiphora\\i0{}, \\i{}Comarum\\i0{} and \\i{}Sibbaldiopsis\\i0{} are recognised as separate genera, we also have to recognise \\i{}Argentina,\\i0{} as it is equally well differentiated (Eriksson et al. 1998) [Pl. Syst. Evol. 211: 155-179]. \\par{}\\i{}Argentina anserina/egedii\\i0{} constitutes a widespread complex where \\i{}A. anserina\\i0{} s.s. is the temperate part and \\i{}A. egedii\\i0{} is the arctic-subarctic part (see Rousi 1965, Hultén 1971). Fertile intermediates are frequent in northwestern and northern Europe in seashore sites where \\i{}A. anserina\\i0{} s.s. and \\i{}A. egedii\\i0{} meet, even if they are partly ecologically separated. \\i{}Argentina egedii\\i0{} is restricted to silty and clayey salt marshes, whereas \\i{}A. anserina\\i0{} s.s. is more frequent on sandy and gravelly shores and especially in driftwalls. The entity described as \\i{}A. egedii\\i0{} var. \\i{}groenlandica\\i0{} (or \\i{}Potentilla anserina\\i0{} var. \\i{}groenlandica\\i0{}) is intermediate between \\i{}A. egedii\\i0{} and \\i{}A. anserina\\i0{} s.s. in some aspects but belongs mainly within the former. Its main distinguishing character seems to be the more or less hairy lower surface of leaves. It is concentrated in the southern parts of the range of \\i{}A. egedii\\i0{} where it meets \\i{}A. anserina\\i0{} s.s. At subspecies level, subsp. \\i{}groenlandica\\i0{} has priority, at species level \\i{}A\\i0{}. \\i{}egedii\\i0{}. \\par{}The hybridisation and the \u0027intermediacy\u0027 of var. \\i{}groenlandica\\i0{} are two reasons for treating \\i{}A. anserina\\i0{} and \\i{}A. egedii\\i0{} as major eco-geographic races, i.e., as two subspecies, instead of as species. In the material from the Arctic islands, all specimens from Victoria and about half of those from Baffin show some \u0027\\i{}groenlandica\\i0{}\u0027 features (i.e., more or less hairy lower leaf surfaces). In these areas, there seems to be intra-population variation not worth taxonomic recognition. However, the indumentum variation is within the \u0027\\i{}egedii\\i0{}\u0027 entity rather than a sign of intermediacy. \\par{}The taxon is a complicated case. In Alaska-Yukon, Hultén (1968b) divided the variation on two species and within \\i{}A. (Potentilla) egedii\\i0{} on three subspecies - one with two varieties - all of which reach the arctic parts. One of the subspecies (\\i{}\u0027yukonensis\u0027\\i0{}) was later transferred by Hultén to \\i{}A. (Potentilla) anserina\\i0{}. In northwestern Europe three entities have been recognised through time, \\i{}A. (Potentilla) anserina\\i0{} and two races of \\i{}A. (Potentilla) egedii\\i0{}. One of these - \\i{}\u0027groenlandica\u0027\\i0{} - is transitional in one feature (lower leaf surface indumentum) between the two species and exemplifies the problem in consistent separation of \\i{}A. anserina\\i0{} and \\i{}A. egedii\\i0{}. \\par{}As \u0027typical\u0027, the two are very different in several presumed independent characters and also differ ecologically. Intermediate habitats are rare, but where they occur, intermediate plants are very often found and there seems to be no barrier except the eco-geographical one. It would be very tempting to treat them as subspecies except that a more deviant race within the \\i{}A. egedii\\i0{} affinity occurs in the Beringian area, namely \\i{}\u0027pacifica\u0027\\i0{} or \\i{}\u0027grandis\u0027\\i0{}. To be able reflect these two levels of differentiation we should perhaps accept two species. In any case, the \\i{}\u0027groenlandica\u0027\\i0{} plants should be included in \\i{}A. egedii\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}egedii\\i0{} as a synonym. The name is accepted in several standard sources, e.g., Hultén (1968b), Löve and Löve (1975, as \\i{}A. anserina\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}groenlandica\\i0{}), and Böcher et al. (1978). If the \\i{}\u0027egedii\u0027\\i0{} entity is considered a subspecies of \\i{}A. argentina\\i0{}, the correct name is also subsp. \\i{}groenlandica\\i0{} (see Soják 1969, Löve 1970).\u003e","\u003cThe choice between recognising this as a species of \\i{}Potentilla\\i0{} or placing it in its own genus \\i{}Comarum\\i0{} is largely a matter of how widely or narrowly \\i{}Potentilla\\i0{} should be circumscribed. If \\i{}Comarum\\i0{} is split off, it also necessitates recognition of \\i{}Anserina\\i0{} and \\i{}Dasiphora\\i0{} as separate genera, whereas an inclusion of these in \\i{}Potentilla\\i0{} should be followed by an inclusion of, for example, \\i{}Fragaria\\i0{} and \\i{}Sibbaldia\\i0{}. Elven et al. (2003) preferred to accept \\i{}Comarum\\i0{} as a separate genus.\u003e","\u003cPorsild (1947) indicated that \\i{}D. integrifolia\\i0{} in North America is by far the most common and widespread member of the genus, and in postglacial time has reoccupied nearly all land surface in the Arctic once occupied by ice. It is an arctic-alpine species, which within its main area is an ubiquitous pioneer species in rocky and gravelly places such as river flats and screes, but less common in dwarf shrub heath where it is rapidly out-competed for space. \\i{}Dryas integrifolia\\i0{} fruits abundantly, and its immature achenes form an important food item for numerous species of small rodents and for several species of birds. \\par{}Porsild (1947) stated that \\i{}D. integrifolia\\i0{} seems to be entirely lacking in ecotypes, an opinion that might be debated based on specimens from the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. He noted that \\i{}D. integrifolia\\i0{} from Greenland, \\i{}D. octopetala\\i0{} s.s. from Europe, and\\i{} D. drummondii\\i0{} from the Canadian Rockies have long been grown commercially and in botanical gardens. They have all preserved their characteristics, and there is little reason to expect that fundamental characters such as the presence or absence of glands would be controlled by ecological variables. He also noted that it would be of considerable interest to grow in cultivation many of the other taxa that have been recognised in the genus. However, many of them occur in inaccessible areas, and fresh seed material cannot be easily procured. \\par{}Juzepchuk (1919, 1929) provided a comprehensive treatment of the genus \\i{}Dryas\\i0{} chiefly dealing with Asiatic plants. Porsild (1947) wrote on the genus in North America, extending the treatment by Juzepczuk to areas in North America where that author had few specimens to work with. A summary of the structure in the genus, as seen by current Russians, is presented by Yurtsev (1997). These authors recognised the subgeneric entities following within the genus: \\par{}\\b{}Section or subgenus\\b0{} \\b\\i{}Nothodryas\\i0{} \\b0{}Juz. has leaves pointed at the base; petals and sepals erect-spreading or quite erect during flowering and receptacles flattened, species \\i{}D. drummondii\\i0{} and \\i{}D. grandis\\i0{}; \\par{}\\b{}Section or subgenus \\i{}Eudryas\\b0\\i0{} Juz., leaves mostly rounded, truncate or sub-cordate at the base; petals and sepals spreading during flowering, receptacles convex. \\par{}Within \\i{}Eudryas\\b{} \\b0\\i0{}the Russian authors recognised the following sub-sections: \\par{}\\b{} Subsection \\i{}Dryas\\i0{},\\b0{} leaves dentate, without punctiform glands, but with feathery hairs (\u0027\\i{}octopetala\\i0{} scales\u0027) along the lower leaf surface midvein, no glandular hairs on the lower surface midvein, e.g., species \\i{}D. octopetala\\i0{} and \\i{}D. ajanensis\\i0{}.\\par{} \\b{}Subsection \\i{}Incisae\\b0\\i0{} Jurtz., leaves crenate or dentate throughout, without punctiform glands, glandular hairs, or feathery hairs, e.g., \\i{}D. incisa\\i0{}.\\par{} \\b{}Subsection \\i{}Tenellae\\i0{} \\b0{}Juz., leaves entire or crenate in basal part only, without punctiform glands, glandular hairs, or feathery hairs, e.g., \\i{}D. integrifolia\\i0{}.\\par{} \\b{}Subsection \\i{}Punctatae\\b0\\i0{} Juz., leaves dentate, with punctiform glands, glandular hairs along the lower leaf midvein, but generally without feathery hairs, e.g., \\i{}D. punctata\\i0{} and \\i{}D. alaskensis\\i0{}.\\par{}Porsild (1947) and Hultén (1959a) considered \\i{}Dryas\\i0{} as an old holarctic genus that is particularly interesting for studies in phytogeography and phylogeny. \\i{}Dryas octopetala\\i0{} is thought to have once had a complete circumpolar distribution reaching North America from Alaska south to Colorado and east to northeastern Greenland. Hultén (1959a) considered \\i{}Dryas\\i0{} to be a tertiary genus that early differentiated into three types, two closely related, \\i{}D. octopetala\\i0{} and \\i{}D. integrifolia\\i0{}, and the third more differentiated, \\i{}D. drummondii\\i0{}, which occurs in western continental North America, and possibly a fourth, \\i{}D. grandis\\i0{}, which occurs in Eastern Russia. He stated that both \\i{}D. octopetala\\i0{} and \\i{}D. integrifolia \\i0{}are probably fairly old and must have existed before the glacial period. During the glacial period, southern isolated populations of \\i{}D. octopetala\\i0{} also occurred in central Europe, in the Caucasus, in Japan, and in the Rocky Mountains, where more or less different races were developed and still remain isolated in most cases. \\par{}Considering the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, Hultén (1959a) stated that this is where \\i{}D. integrifolia \\i0{}is presumed to have survived the glacial period and to have hybridised with \\i{}D. octopetala\\i0{} so strongly that today only a remnant of the hybrid is left, while in eastern Greenland \\i{}D. octopetala\\i0{} still survives, although a large part of its population apparently shows the hybrid influence of \\i{}D. integrifolia\\i0{} in lacking \\i{}octopetala\\i0{} scales. \\par{}Hultén (1959a) considered hairs, glands, and scales on the leaves are very good characters for identifying the different races within the \\i{}D. octopetala\\i0{} complex, while the form of the leaves and other characteristics used for that purpose he considered less reliable. He described \\i{}octopetala\\i0{} scales as long, narrow, more or less flat brownish coloured tuft-like scales, built up of several rows of cells with white hairs on their margins. The scales occur on the underside of the leaves on the leaf mid-nerve and to a lesser extent on the lateral nerves. Hultén (1959a) commented that it is remarkable that \\i{}octopetala\\i0{} scales, which are so significant for some taxa, can be missing where they would be expected and occur where they are not expected. For example, \\i{}D. octopetala-\\i0{}like taxa lacking \\i{}octopetala\\i0{} scales occur in Alaska and in East Greenland. \\par{}Hultén (1959a) offered the opinion that \\i{}D. integrifolia\\i0{} is supposed to have occurred in the Rocky Mountains, south of its present range and also in eastern Asia westwards to Lake Bajkal, but was so strongly influenced by \\i{}D. octopetala\\i0{} there that only hybrids remain today, except in the northeastern corner of Asia where \\i{}D. integrifolia\\i0{} still occurs. In unglaciated Alaska and Yukon, races of both \\i{}D. integrifolia\\i0{} (subsp. \\i{}sylvatica\\i0{} Hultén) and \\i{}D. octopetala\\i0{} (subsp. \\i{}alaskensis\\i0{} Porsild) developed during the glacial period. There the areas of at least six different entities (not counting \\i{}D. drummondii)\\i0{} overlap and cross more or less freely and can only more or less arbitrarily be distinguished from each other. Cody (1996) provides a key to these taxa. Hultén (1959a) provided a key to taxa and hybrids that he recognised. \\par{}In the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, Hultén (1959a) recognised \\i{}D. integrifolia\\i0{} Vahl subsp. \\i{}integrifolia\\i0{} ×\\i{}octopetala\\i0{} L., citing specimens collected from Southampton Island and Prince Patrick Island, but subsequent authors have not recognised this hybrid. \\par{}Nordal et al. (1999) held a workshop to discuss a proposed treatment of the genus \\i{}Dryas\\i0{} for the Panarctic Flora Checklist (Elven et al. 2003). Yurtsev (1984, 1997) recognised 15 species in the genus globally and of these nine reach the Arctic. The taxa are mainly defined and delimited by characters from indumentum, glands (presence/absence and types), and leaf shape, incision, and structure. The workshop provided a modified translation of the key given by Yurtsev (1997), with hybrid combinations that he proposed removed. The discussions concerned the interpretation of the morphological variation and its taxonomic significance, especially the use of single characters and of the assumptions of hybridogenous origins of taxa with intermediate features. No consensus was reached. The conclusion was that here is an obvious need for modern analyses of both arctic and non-arctic \\i{}Dryas, \\i0{}involving both more extensive morphological analyses, investigation of molecular markers, and further application of eco-geographic methods. \\par{}The common name \u0027mountain avens\u0027 is also used for the species \\i{}Dryas octopetala\\i0{} in northern Europe. \\par{}The flowers of \\i{}Dryas\\i0{} are heliotropic and face the sun as it moves across the horizon. The flower sepals in bud often appear black from the many coarse hairs that may be glandular-tipped. Occasionally, these hairs are absent and the sepals appear grey-green (see, for example, Baffin Island, Camp Kungovik, \\i{}J.D. Soper 125996\\i0{}, 15 July 1929. CAN 74264).\u003e","\u003cThe name \\i{}P. arenosa\\i0{} is accepted over \\i{}P. hookeriana \\i0{}after a reconsideration of the types (Elven, personal communication, 2005). Jurtsev and Soják (personal communication) have long asserted that Lehmann\u0027s type of \\i{}P. hookeriana\\i0{}, which has a restricted distibution in the southern Cordilleran, is possibly a hybrid, and is inapplicable for the widespread arctic-boreal plant(s). Bente Eriksen (personal communication) has also studied the type and concurs. This means that the priority name must be \\i{}P. arenosa\\i0{}, if we consider the Russian and the American plants as the same, which we do.\\par{}This is a circumpolar taxon that is very common in both the high and Low Arctic parts and often with isolated occurrences in temperate mountains.\\par{}At least six names at species level have been considered within this group of races or closely related species: \\i{}P. hookeriana\\i0{} (1849 described from western North America), \\i{}P. nipharga\\i0{} (1908), \\i{}P. arenosa\\i0{} (1941) (described as a variety of \\i{}P. nivea\\i0{} in 1843 from Russia), \\i{}P. kuznetzovii\\i0{} (1941 described from Russia), \\i{}P. chamissonis\\i0{} (1945 described from Sweden), and also \\i{}P. nivea\\i0{} L. sensu Soják 1989, non Eriksen et al. 1999. North American and Greenland usage has focussed on \\i{}P. arenosa\\i0{} and \\i{}P. chamissonis\\i0{}, northwestern European usage on \\i{}P. chamissonis\\i0{}, and Russian usage on \\i{}P. arenosa\\i0{}, \\i{}P. chamissonis\\i0{}, and \\i{}P. kuznetzovii\\i0{}. The taxa are similar morphologically. There is close affinity across the North Atlantic, as emphasised by, e.g., Hultén (1945), and a similar close affinity occurs among plants on either side of the Bering Strait as emphasised by several authors. The major pattern is here interpreted as one widely Amphi-Atlantic entity and one widely Amphi-Beringian and American entity. \\par{}The name \u0027\\i{}chamissonis\\i0{}\u0027 relates to the North Atlantic entity and probably also the name \u0027\\i{}kuznetzovii\u0027\\i0{}, whereas the names \\i{}\u0027arenosa\u0027\\i0{} and \\i{}\u0027nivea\u0027\\i0{} sensu Soják relate to the amphi-Beringian plants. The name \\i{}\u0027hookeriana\u0027\\i0{}, previously applied to the almost circumpolar species, most probably belongs to a more local entity, perhaps a hybrid, in Rocky Mountains (according to independent evaluations by J. Soják / B. Yurtsev and by B. Eriksen). The name \\i{}\u0027nipharga\u0027\\i0{} is much more enigmatic. It is currently applied to a plant of arctic northeastern Canada and Greenland, strongly resembling \\i{}P. arenosa\\i0{} s.s., but differing in the hairs of the petioles. \\i{}Potentilla arenosa\\i0{} s.s. has a characteristic combination of stiff, long, verrucose hairs and an understory of very short, stiff hairs. The understory on the petioles of \\i{}P. nipharga\\i0{} consists of short, curved hairs. Another problem is that the name \\i{}P. nipharga\\i0{} is typified on plants from northwestern Canada (Fort Good Hope on the Mackenzie River, leg. I.S. Onion, type in NY), outside the range where the entity currently is accepted. Soják and Russian authors (e.g., Yurtsev) consider \\i{}P. nipharga\\i0{} as specifically different from \\i{}P. arenosa\\i0{}. If they are merged, \\i{}P. nipharga\\i0{} Rydb., 1908, has priority before \\i{}P. arenosa\\i0{} (Turcz.) Juz. 1941.\\par{}The two main geographical entities are connected by specimens that appear to be morphologically intermediate both in North America, Greenland, and northern Eurasia. They are therefore better treated as subspecies than as species, as was done by Hultén (1968b). However, as the name has not yet been published for subsp. \\i{}chamissonis\\i0{}, in this Flora we treat them as species.\u003e","\u003cSee \\i{}Potentilla arenosa\\i0{} for notes.\u003e","\u003cThe species is very variable in northern Europe, which is the centre of distribution, and both sexual and apomictic reproduction has been reported (Asker and Jerling 1992, Nyléhn 2002). Attempts to subdivide the variation into taxa have not been generally accepted. In the Arctic, there seems to be comparatively little variation from eastern Canada through Greenland to Jan Mayen and Svalbard. The number of leaflets varies from three to five, and variation in number may occur within populations and within plants. Soják (1985, in determinations) restricted \\i{}P. crantzii\\i0{} to the regularly digitate-leaved plants, whereas the ternate-leaved ones were considered as \\i{}P. gelida\\i0{} C.A. Meyer subsp. \\i{}boreo-asiatica\\i0{} Jurtz. and R. Kamel. and plants with mixed leaves were considered as the hybrid species \\i{}P.\\i0{} ×\\i{}scandica\\i0{} Soják. This treatment is not in accordance with genetic patterns (Hansen et al. 2000, Hamre 2000, Nyléhn 2002) and also obscures the possible significance of the differences between the Atlantic \\i{}P. crantzii\\i0{} and the mainly Asian \\i{}P. gelida\\i0{}. The Canadian plants are predominantly digitate (five leaflets). \\par{}Kartesz (1994) suggested that \\i{}P. crantzii\\i0{} may be synonymous with \\i{}Potentilla tabernaemontani\\i0{} Aschers. (\\i{}P. neumanniana\\i0{} Reichenb.), a species recognised as distinctly different from \\i{}P. crantzii\\i0{} in all recent European sources. Elven (personal communication, 2005) stated this has been investigated, and \\i{}P. tabernaemontani\\i0{} is an apomictic, hybridogenous complex where \\i{}P. crantzii\\i0{} partakes, but is not an important part. The Canadian plants are \\i{}P. crantzii\\i0{} and nothing else.\\par{}Elven (personal communication, 2005) noted that \"Kamelin, in Tzvelev (2001), claimed that the priority name for \\i{}P. crantzii\\i0{} should be \\i{}P. verna\\i0{}. The name \\i{}P. verna\\i0{} has been applied for several different plants and has scarcely been applied at all the last 100 years. Kamelin did not designate a lectotype, and the original material of Linnaeus\u0027 \\i{}P. verna\\i0{} is heterogeneous. It consists, according to Cafferty and Jarvis (2002) of \\i{}P. crantzii\\i0{} (LINN 655.23), \\i{}P. aurea\\i0{} (Haller 1740, t. 6, f. 4), \\i{}P. grandiflora\\i0{} (UPS Burser XVIII(2): 1), and an uncertain plant (LINN 655.24). To preserve current usage without formally rejecting \\i{}P. verna\\i0{}, Cafferty and Jarvis (2002, in \\i{}Taxon\\i0{}) selected the Burser specimen as lectotype, making \\i{}P. verna\\i0{} into a synonym of \\i{}P. grandiflora\\i0{} L., which resolved this question.\"\u003e","\u003cThe long accepted name \\i{}P. emarginata\\i0{} Pursh, 1814, has to be rejected, as it is a later homonym of \\i{}P. emarginata\\i0{} Desv. 1804. The priority name at species level depends on whether or not the marginal populations in the temperate White Mountains (New Hampshire, \\i{}P. robbinsiana\\i0{} Oakes) and/or those in the Aleutian and Commodore islands (\\i{}P. nana\\i0{} Willd. ex Schltdl.) are included. \\i{}Potentilla nana\\i0{} was described in 1813-1816 and is the oldest name in the group. Russian authors consider it as a distinct and separate species, but the matter is not closed. \\i{}Potentilla robbinsiana\\i0{} was described in 1840, long before \\i{}P. hyparctica\\i0{} Malte was described from Ellesmere Island. They were united with the arctic plants at species level (but treated as different subspecies) by Löve and Solbrig (1964) and Löve and Löve (1965). However, Hultén (1946) considered \\i{}P. robbinsiana\\i0{} more closely related to the mainly Asian \\i{}P. elegans\\i0{} Cham. and Schltdl. Pending a more thorough comparison between \\i{}P. hyparctica, P. nana\\i0{}, and \\i{}P. robbinsiana\\i0{}, the former name is retained for the arctic plants. A parallel alpine taxon in northeastern Asia has been described as \\i{}P. pulviniformis\\i0{} Khokhr. Similar slightly deviating alpine plants, currently identified as \\i{}P. hyparctica\\i0{}, are known from southern Alaska and Scandinavia. \\par{}The material from the Canadian Arctic falls into two fairly distinct entities, here only named Northern Race and Southern Race. The Northern Race contains the majority of the plants found throughout the Arctic islands except for southern Baffin and also on several of the northern mainland peninsulas. It has been named as \\i{}P. groenlandica\\i0{} R. Br. The Southern Race contains the majority of plants that occur in southern Baffin Island, the islands in Hudson Bay (except for Southampton), and on the mainland from Alaska to Labrador. It has also been named as var. \\i{}elatior\\i0{} (Abromeit) Fernald. The types behind these names have not yet been studied. \\par{}The two races differ fairly consistently; there seems to be comparatively little overlap in characters and distributions. They are, however, obviously closely related and should be considered as major geographical races, i.e., as subspecies rather than species. The two races differ in several morphological features, as seen from the descriptions. Northern Race plants are more slender, more hairy, with leaflets that are more dissected and with more acute lobes. They have much smaller and more acute calyx and epicalyx segments. All Ellesmere Island specimens from CAN and DAO belong to this \u0027majority\u0027 race, and the type specimen of \\i{}P. hyparctica\\i0{} also belongs here. The Asian \\i{}P. pulviniformis\\i0{} is very close to the Northern Race. \\par{}Southern Race plants are taller, have rounded leaflet lobes, and large and rounded epicalyx and calyx segments. As plants matching this description predominate on continental North America, it is at least probable that the type of \\i{}P. robbinsiana\\i0{} could belong to the southern race, but this must be checked against the type. \\par{}Formal names for the races are not proposed here, mainly because the variation outside eastern Canada was not analysed. There might be relevant names also available from other regions. \\par{}The data for the two races were scored independently. When it was compared the following differences were noted. \\par{}Plant heights: southern race (2-)5-15(-20) cm, northern race, (1-)5-12(-15) cm\\par{}Stipule widths: southern race (2-)3-5(-6), northern race 1-2(-3) mm \\par{}Petiole lengths: southern race (10-)15-40(-60) mm, northern race (5-)10-20(-40) mm \\par{}Sessile glands on petioles: southern race sparse, northern race, abundant\\par{}Leaf blade lengths: southern race (5-)12-30(-35) mm, northern race (5-)8-15(-20) mm\\par{}Leaf blade widths: southern race (10-)12-25(-30) mm, northern race (8-)10-15(-20) mm\\par{}Leaflet blade lengths: southern race (5-)8-20(-22) mm, northern race (4-)6-12(-15) mm\\par{}Leaflet blade widths: southern race (4-)8-15(-18) mm, northern race (3-)5-8(-12) mm\\par{}Leaflet blade margins degree of incision: southern race 5-60%, northern race 25-75%\\par{}Apical leaflet: southern race maybe stipitate, northern race, not stipitate\\par{}Epicalyx segments lengths: southern race 3-6 mm, northern race 2.5-4 mm\\par{}Epicalyx segments widths: southern race 2-3.5(-4) mm, northern race 1-1.5 mm\\par{}Sepal lengths: southern race 6.5-8 mm, northern race 4-6(-8) mm\\par{}Sepal widths: southern race (2.8-)3-3.5 mm, northern race 2.2-3 mm\\par{}Petals widths: southern race (4-)5-8(-9) mm, northern race (3.5-)4-6(-7) mm\\par{}Fruit length: southern race 1.2-1.5 mm, northern race 0.9-1.2 mm\\par{}Fruit width: southern race 0.9-1.2 mm, northern race 0.7-1 mm\\par{}Distribution: southern race, not in N.W.T. islands, southern race not in Labrador and Quebec.\u003e","\u003cAs defined here, \\i{}P. nivea\\i0{} is a circumpolar entity. It reaches the High Arctic in Greenland and Svalbard but is distinctly Low Arctic in the Canadian Arctic Islands. The Baffin island plants are uniformly trifoliate and densely tomentose (floccose), with almost no straight hairs, and they match \\i{}P. nivea\\i0{} L. s.s. The Victoria island plants have some straight hairs and also some other characters that may be indicative of some influence from the \\i{}P. arenosa\\i0{} subgroup. They differ, however, appreciably from the Beringian entity (\\i{}P. crebridens \\i0{}or \\i{}P. nivea\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}hemicryophila\\i0{}). \\par{}The name \\i{}P. nivea\\i0{} L. subsp. \\i{}nivea\\i0{} might be applicable for the eastern Canadian plants if the current, mainly genetically based, entities are separated as subspecies. Relations between the Canadian and European plants, and the variation in Greenland, need to be ascertained by genetic investigations before any firm taxonomic and nomenclatural conclusions can be drawn.\u003e","\u003cInterruptedly circumpolar, almost exclusively in the Arctic but with many gaps, especially in Russia-Siberia. The gaps are probably a result of the species\u0027 strong affinity for dry and distinctly basic substrates.\\par{}\\i{}Potentilla pulchella\\i0{} is fairly unambiguous in an arctic context and might be seen as a comparatively homogeneous arctic counterpart of the much more diverse boreal-temperate \\i{}P. multifida\\i0{} L. complex (including \\i{}P. bimundorum\\i0{} Soják and \\i{}P. virgulata\\i0{} Nels.) that does not reach the Arctic islands. \\par{}Variety \\i{}gracilicaulis\\i0{} A.E. Porsild was described to encompass more southern and western plants and was said to differ from the \u0027main\u0027 race (described from Melville Island) in being taller and with less hairy leaves. It was typified from Canada: Atkinson Pt., 01.-03.08.1927, leg. A.E.Porsild and R.T.Porsild 3632 (CAN) holotype. There is a wide range in size and indumentum in this species. Very tall plants are commonly found in manured sites, and populations of sub-glabrous plants are sometimes found in exposed coastal situations like shore terraces. A test of three such \u0027morphs\u0027 from Svalbard found that each of them kept some of the same appearance in cultivation but were inseparable in genetic markers (isozymes and RAPDs) (Hansen et al. 2000, Hamre 2000). Most of the numerous isoenzyme multiloci phenotypes were found in all three \u0027morphs\u0027, and they were interpreted as phenetic responses. Variety \\i{}gracilicaulis\\i0{} might be one or more of such phenetic \u0027morphs\u0027 and thereby not worth recognition as a variety. \\par{}There is a geographical pattern in the variation in North America that might merit further analysis. In addition to the western \\i{}\u0027gracilicaulis\u0027\\i0{} plants, a conspicuously robust and hairy entity occurs in the Hudson Bay region. Other recognisable patterns are found in other regions outside North America. At present (2005), we proposed to keep this widespread and variable species as one entity throughout the circumpolar area.\u003e","\u003cWhat here is entered as a \\i{}P. rubricaulis\\i0{} aggregate is a possibly artificial group of plants that have mainly three features in common: leaves digitate (more than three leaflets attached at about the same point) or semipinnate (more than three leaflets attached along a very short axis); an often silky indumentum of long, often shiny hairs on both leaf surfaces (and on other parts); and multiflowered stems. They are interpreted by J. Soják and B. Yurtsev (personal communication) as probably agamospermic derivatives from hybrids between several species of sect. \\i{}Niveae\\i0{} (both the \\i{}P. nivea\\i0{} group and the \\i{}P. uniflora\\i0{} group) and at least two species of sect. \\i{}Multifidae\\i0{} (\\i{}P. anachoretica\\i0{}, \\i{}P. pulchella\\i0{}, perhaps also \\i{}P. bimundorum\\i0{} in the case of \\i{}P. rubricaulis\\i0{} s. str.).\\par{}The hypotheses of Soják and Yurtsev may well be true as to the origin of the aggregate. It still leaves the question whether it is feasible (and worthwhile) to try to classify such agamic complexes. In this aggregate, some of the entities are comparatively widespread and may be locally common. They cannot be ignored. However, they often vary morphologically from island to island, and sometimes from site to site. It is evident that their evolutionary background is diverse and includes several parental species. The choice is between a collective treatment and a treatment as several species. The former option is chosen here, as the data needed for a more detailed taxonomic treatment still are absent. Numerous taxa have been described from northeastern Asia and Alaska (and one from the European North Atlantic), but it is uncertain or even improbable whether these are the relevant ones in northern Canada and Greenland. The variation in northern Canada is much too large to fit well into the two taxa described from this area. This is a matter for further studies.\\par{}For North America and Greenland, the following seven entities have been proposed. The suggested origins are indicated.\\par{}\\b\\i{}Potentilla rubricaulis\\i0{} Lehm\\b0{}. Perhaps originating from \\i{}P. bimundorum\\i0{} Soják (\\i{}Multifidae\\i0{}) and \\i{}P. arenosa\\i0{} s.l. (\\i{}Niveae\\i0{}). This entity, described from Mackenzie District, occurs north to Liverpool Bay and Cape Dalhousie, but is unlikely to occur in the archipelago islands.\\par{}\\b\\i{}Potentilla pedersenii\\i0{} Rydberg\\b0{} Probably originating from \\i{}P. pulchella\\i0{} R. Br. (\\i{}Multifidae\\i0{}) and a species of sect. \\i{}Niveae\\i0{}. This entity, described from Greenland, is probably a name that is relevant for at least some plants from the northeastern islands.\\par{}\\b\\i{}Potentilla borealis\\i0{} Soják\\b0{} Probably originating from \\i{}P. anachoretica\\i0{} Soják (\\i{}Multifidae\\i0{}) and \\i{}P. arenosa\\i0{} s. str. (\\i{}Niveae\\i0{}). This entity, described from West Chukotka, has been reported from Alaska and may occur in the western archipelago islands.\\par{}\\b\\i{}Potentilla petrovskyi\\i0{} Soják \\b0{}Probably originating from \\i{}P. anachoretica\\i0{} Soják (\\i{}Multifidae\\i0{}) and \\i{}P. nivea\\i0{} s. lat. (\\i{}Niveae\\i0{}, most probably subsp. \\i{}hemicryophila\\i0{} or \\i{}P. crebridens\\i0{}). This entity, described from South Chukotka, has also been reported from Alaska and may occur in the western archipelago islands.\\par{}\\b\\i{}Potentilla tschaunensis\\i0{} Juz. ex Jurtz.\\b0{} This entity probably has the same general origin. It is described from West Chukotka, reported from Alaska, and may occur in the western archipelago islands.\\par{}\\b\\i{}Potentilla murrayi\\i0{} Jurtz. \\b0{}Probably originating from \\i{}P. anachoretica\\i0{} Soják (\\i{}Multifidae\\i0{}) and a species of the \\i{}P. uniflora\\i0{} group (\\i{}Niveae\\i0{}, Yurtsev proposed \\i{}P. subvahliana\\i0{} Jurtz. as the parent). This entity, described from Brooks Range in northern Alaska, might be relevant in northwestern Canada.\\par{}\\b\\i{}Potentilla insularis\\i0{} Soják\\b0{} Proposed by Soják as originating from \\i{}P. lyngei\\i0{} Jurtz. and Soják (\\i{}Multifidae\\i0{}) and \\i{}P. arenosa\\i0{} (Trautv.) Juz. subsp. \\i{}chamissonis\\i0{} (Hultén). This origin has been disputed (Hansen et al. 2000, Hamre 2000), because \\i{}P. lyngei\\i0{} is absent from the area where it occurs and because the \\i{}Multifidae\\i0{} species that is present (\\i{}P. pulchella\\i0{}) does not seem to be involved. It is reported from Svalbard and much more doubtfully from Greenland. As it certainly is closely related to, and probably derived from, \\i{}P. arenosa\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}chamissonis\\i0{}, it may well occur in northern Canada.\u003e","\u003cSee also notes for \\i{}P. vahliana\\i0{}. Several specimens from Banks and Victoria Islands, previously included in \\i{}P. vahliana\\i0{}, differ from that relatively common taxon by having a pure white indumentum, slightly more deeply dissected leaflets, and most conspicuously by lacking an elongated caudex thickly covered by leaf remains. These specimens were redetermined to \\i{}P. uniflora\\i0{}, being inseparable morphologically from specimens of \\i{}P. uniflora\\i0{} collected on continental North America. They have previously been overlooked, both in the islands and on the mainland coast east of the Mackenzie River, and the species distribution may be more widespread in the archipelago than indicated here.\\par{}The holotype specimen is recorded from the Russian Far East, \u0027Terra Tschuktschorum ad sin. St. Lawrentii\u0027, leg. \\i{}Eschscholtz\\i0{}, in LE. \\i{}Potentilla uniflora\\i0{} in the current meaning has not been observed at Lavrentiya (St. Lawrence Bay) (Yurtsev, personal communication, 2003). The earlier collection which might have been available to Ledebour is Adams\u0027 collection from the lower reaches of Lena River and Bykov Mts. in northern Yakutia. These plants look like Ledebour\u0027s paratypes.\u003e","\u003cCanadian plants that Yurtsev had identified as \\i{}P. subvahliana\\i0{} were redetermined by Elven to \\i{}P. vahliana\\i0{} in 2000, following a comparison with Greenland plants identified by Yurtsev as \\i{}P. vahliana\\i0{} s.s. The single specimen annotated as \\i{}P. subvahliana\\i0{} by Soják in CAN and DAO is a \\i{}P. uniflora\\i0{} hybrid with \\i{}P. arenosa\\i0{} (probably a F1 hybrid). The western limit of the distribution in the arctic islands of \\i{}P. vahliana\\i0{} seems to be Banks and Victoria. Reports from northern Alaska (Hultén 1968b) are not confirmed, and no specimens of \\i{}P. vahliana\\i0{} from the northern Yukon or northern Alaska have been found in CAN or DAO. There might be a (slightly) different plant (a low-ploidal entity) on the west side of the Bering Straits, justifying the recognition of \\i{}P. subvahliana\\i0{} Jurtz., but further study is needed on the differences between \\i{}P. vahliana\\i0{} and \\i{}P. subvahliana\\i0{}. Thus, the name \\i{}P. vahliana\\i0{} is applied for the Canadian plants.\\par{}Sometimes the differences between \\i{}P. vahliana\\i0{} and \\i{}P. uniflora \\i0{}are slight. Some specimens from continental North America eastwards from the Mackenzie River seem to combine characters and are difficult to assign with certainty. Treating members of this aggregate as subspecies might be more appropriate, but as ploidy level differences are reported (Löve and Löve 1975), they are currently treated as species.\u003e","\u003cSmall and Catling (2000b) have written an extensive and informative review of cloudberry. They state the name is \"from the Latin \\i{}rubus\\i0{}, bramble, from \\i{}ruber\\i0{}, meaning red, an allusion to red dye obtained from fruits of some of the species. \\i{}Chamaemorus\\i0{}, from the Greek \\i{}chamai\\i0{} and \\i{}moron.\\i0{} First applied for this species by Carolus Clusius, 1601. The word \\i{}chamae\\i0{}, which means on the ground, a reference to the low habit.\" (p. 43). \\par{}\"Cloudberry has an extensive creeping and branching system of slender woody rhizomes covered with brownish papery bark. The rhizomes can grow down to a depth of 30 cm,\" and in southern areas have an average length of about 1 m (Small and Catling 2000b). Cloudberry propagates predominantly by these subterranean rhizomes, which grow about 10 cm below the substrate surface. Such vegetative reproduction has been said to be the best strategy for reproduction in the unpredictable climate of high latitudes. While seeds are necessary to colonise sites, seedlings are rarely observed under natural conditions. That \\i{}R. chamaemorus\\i0{} is dioecious has been the subject of many evolutionary research studies. Cloudberry stands often have a dominance of male plants, with less than 25% of the flowering shoots female. \"This has been attributed partly to greater competitive ability of male plants, and partly to greater flower production by the males. The important fly and bee pollinators show a strong preference for male flowers, which are larger, provide pollen and much more nectar. This seemingly excessive favouring of the male sex may be related to the relatively low dependence of the species on sexual reproduction\" (Small and Catling 2000b, p. 44). \\par{}\\i{}Rubus chamaemorus \\i0{}is the only species in the subgenus \\i{}Chamaemorus\\i0{} which is characterised by annual aerial stems, simple leaves, and yellow fruit. The species has crossed spontaneously (and has been artificially crossed) with the common raspberry, but the offspring of these crosses have been sterile. \\par{}Moose and caribou browse the aerial shoots. In Northern areas heavy frost, snowfalls, or rain during flowering may result in very limited or no seed production. \"Female flowers appear to be more susceptible to frost than the male flowers. Good snow cover has been observed to delay flowering until the danger of frost damage is reduced\". (Small and Catling 2000b, p. 45)\\par{}In Canada, it is considered that the best way to harvest is to \"pick a combination of the hard red fruit and the soft golden fruit. The hard red fruits seem to have a high pectin content and when cooked produce a delicious apricot-like flavour, but using only the hard red berries produces too thick and dry a preserve. The soft golden fruit is fragile, deteriorates easily, and when cooked without some hard red fruits produces a slightly runny product with an inferior flavour. The fresh berries will keep for several weeks in a refrigerator.\" (Small and Catling 2000b, p. 45). However, in the Nordic countries (Norway, Sweden, and Finland) it is against the law (and quite often also punished) to pick the red fruits, and jam with some red fruits is considered vastly inferior (Elven, personal communication, 2005). \\par{}\"The Finnish liqueur Lakka and the Quebec liqueur Chicoutai are both distilled from cloudberry....Cloudberries have a high content (50-150 mg per 100 g of fruit) of ascorbic acid (vitamin C), which is retained well when the berries are frozen or otherwise preserved immediately after picking. The berries are also rich in benzoic acid (ca 50 mg/100 g of fruit), which promotes good storage. Aromatic compounds are prevalent in cloudberry and produce a very pleasing and unique scent. More than 100 volatiles have been identified, the most important of which are ethyl hexanoate, 4-vinylphenol, 2-methoxy-5-vinylphenol, 2-methylbutanoic acid, hexanal benzyl alcohol, and 2-phenyl-ethanol. The volatile compounds may be used to identify cultivars.\" \\par{}\"The seeds of cloudberry have tested positive for amygdalin, a poisonous cyanogenetic compound, which may function as a germination inhibitor. There has been no suggestion that the concentrations are sufficient to raise concern, and cloudberries are considered non-toxic.\" (Small and Catling 2000b, p. 45).\u003e","\u003cPolunin (1940) commented that this seems to be an unusually good monomorph and that he could see no constant difference between the material from the eastern Arctic Archipelago and specimens collected in widely separated parts of Europe and Asia. In the Canadian Arctic, it generally grows in rather close, low tufts, whose very tallest axes scarcely reach 10 cm, but which flower and fruit quite plentifully. \\par{}Galen and Stanton (1995) studied responses of snowbed plant species to changes in the length of a growing season. \"Over the course of the experiment, growing season length had significant effects on absolute and relative cover of the species studied (\\i{}P\\i0{} \\u8804\\\u00273f 0.025 and \\i{}P\\i0{} \\u8804\\\u00273f 0.005, respectively), and these effects were similar near both the edge and centre of the snowbed. Yet, only for the snowbed specialist, \\i{}Sibbaldia procumbens\\i0{}, were changes in absolute and relative cover under early and late snowmelt schedules predictable from the species\u0027 distribution along the historical snow depth gradient. \\i{}Sibbaldia procumben\\i0{}s increased in cover under a long growing season and was more common in historically early-melting portions of the snowbed.\" (p. 1546).\u003e","\u003cThe Yukon territorial flower. \\par{}Mosquin (1966) studied the taxonomy (of what he called \\i{}Epilobium angustifolium\\i0{}) because he wished to establish the way in which chromosomal discontinuity correlated with morphological discontinuities after three chromosomal races with \\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d18, 36, and 54 had been discovered (Mulligan 1957 and Mosquin 1963). Mosquin recognised subspecies \\i{}angustifolium\\i0{}, \\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 18 and 54, and subspecies \\i{}circumvagum\\i0{} Mosquin, \\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 36, the later based on \\i{}Chamaenerion angustifolium\\i0{} var. \\i{}platyphyllum\\i0{} Daniels. The best characters for distinguishing the taxa are the pubescence, or lack of it, on the abaxial leaf midribs, the leaf width and length, whether the pollen is triporate, or a mixture of pore sizes, and the diameter of the pollen. Mosquin (1966) mapped the distribution of 95 chromosome records; a map that indicates that plants with 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 36 are not found as far north as 60°N. \\par{}Mosquin (1966) stated that white-flowered forms are generally most common in 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 18 plants, less common in 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 36 plants, and apparently unknown among 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 54 plants. \\par{}Mosquin and Small (1971, p. 680, 681) considered that \\i{}C. angustifolium\\i0{} and \\i{}C. latifolium \\i0{}represent an example of parallel evolution and that \"although the two species are closely related, evidence indicates that they are isolated by ecological and genetic barriers. [They admitted that] F1 hybrids have been collected from transitional habitats (Böcher 1962) [but noted that hybrids are] extremely infrequent in view of the occurrence of widespread areas of sympatry... Attempts to cross the two species have given variable results (Pugsley 1960, Mosquin, unpubl.) but generally revealed strong barriers to F1 seed production coupled with marked F1 pollen sterility. While these barriers were not considered sufficiently well developed to have prevented introgression between the two species, [Mosquin and Small (1971) stated that] there iss no indication of this in the polyploids, which closely resemble their diploid progenitors, and do not possess characters attributable to introgression from their sister species. \\par{}Evidence for parallelism comes from five observations: \\par{}(1) Both species occupy comparably widespread ranges in the northern hemisphere... \\par{}(2) In each species diploids occupy the more northern and/or alpine areas, while polyploids occur in more southern and/or warmer regions. \\par{}(3) In each species autopolyploidy has been the mechanism of polyploidisation. \\par{}(4) Each species has retained the capacity to form high levels of quadrivalents at meiosis, unlike many other autopolyploids (Morrison and Rajhathy 1960). \\par{}(5) Within each species the diploids very closely resemble the polyploids.\" \\par{}Mosquin and Small (1971) suggested \"the evolution of polyploidy has been accompanied by a common morphological change, namely an increase in frequency of extra pores in the pollen grains.\" (p. 682). \\par{}Small and Catling (1999) noted that despite the \\ldblquote{}weed\\rdblquote{} in fireweed, this species is not usually a significant weed in Canada, although it is a weed in Europe. Potential problems for forest managers may exist, since \\i{}C. angustifolium\\i0{} seedlings can compete with conifer seedlings in revegetating burned land, and \\i{}C. angustifolium\\i0{} serves as the alternative host of conifer rusts. Fireweed has also been observed to be a weed of some vegetable crops in northern regions. \\par{}Inbreeding depression, which is reduced fitness following self-fertilisation, is extreme in fireweed, making cross-pollination very important. Individual flowers mature their pollen before the stigma is receptive, which prevents selfing. Bees, bumblebees, moths, and butterflies are important pollinators of fireweed. They characteristically move from the bottom towards the top of the flowering stem. The insects visit the lower flowers, which have opened first, have already shed their pollen, and have receptive stigmas. They then move up the inflorescence where they acquire pollen from the upper flowers, which have not yet exposed their stigmas (Small and Catling 1999, Galen and Plowright 1985, Husband and Schemske 1997). \\par{}A fruit of fireweed can contain as many as 500 seeds, and a single plant may produce as many as 80,000 seeds per year (Small and Catling 1999). The plumose seeds can be carried by wind for hundreds of kilometres (Solbreack and Andersson 1987). A Swedish study revealed that up to half of the seed produced disperses over the landscape more than 100 m above the ground. Humidity expands the diameter of the seed hairs, decreasing loft, an adaptation that tends to deposit the seeds in humid areas and during wet periods. The seeds are non-dormant and short-lived, rarely remaining viable for more than 3 years and generally germinating as soon as a suitable site is found. \\par{}Although seeds account for the remarkable ability of fireweed to colonise new areas, once a seed germinates, vegetative reproduction by rhizomes becomes more important than sexual reproduction. Fragmentation of the rhizomes stimulates production of shoots, contributing to the reputation of fireweed as a hard-to-eradicate weed. Most of the rhizomes occur in the top 5 cm of mineral soils, and this underground portion can survive relatively intense fires. The aboveground shoots of older plants are killed by frost, but the plants overwinter as rhizomes (Small and Catling 1999). Fireweed sprouted quickly from surviving rhizomes, following the volcanic eruption of Mount St. Helens, Washington, in 1980. One year after the explosion, 81% of all seedlings present were from fireweed. \\par{}Fireweed is not considered toxic. Compounds, such as an unusual flavonoid myricetin 3-O-ß-D-glucuronide, with strong healing antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects, have been found in the foliage. This active principle reaches its maximum concentration during and shortly after the plants flower (Ducrey et al. 1995). In Norway we sometimes (not very often) make a very nice and refreshing drink from it, boiling fresh leaves. There has been no rumour of poisonous effects at all in Europe; it is rather seen as a useful (but slightly noxious weedy) plant (Elven, personal communication, 2005).\\par{}It has been suggested that mutations from the radiation near uranium deposits results in a relatively high frequency of white-flowered variants of fireweed, and that this phenomenon can be used to find uranium (Shacklette 1964). \\par{}This species was found to be an early coloniser of oil spills in Alaska (Kershaw and Kershaw 1986). It is an early and efficient coloniser almost everywhere.\\par{}Porsild annotated a specimen (CAN 223779) that was collected from the Gull cliffs opposite Pangnirtung on 15 August 1953 by V.C. Wynne-Edwards as \\i{}Epilobium angustifolium\\i0{} L. × \\i{}E. latifolium\\i0{} L. On the label is the note, \"both parent species and every gradation of hybrid, in profusion on manured ground beneath the gull cliff opposite Pangnirtung Post. \\i{}C. latifolium\\i0{} was already finished flowering. \\i{}E. angustifolium\\i0{} only in bud, and the hybrids make a great show of colour.\" Peter C. Hoch, Missouri Botanical Garden, annotated the specimen in 1979 as \\i{}E. angustifolium\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}angustifolium\\i0{}. The observed difference in flowering time would make hybridisation less likely. \\par{}\u003e","\u003cNumerous infraspecific taxa of \\i{}C. latifolium\\i0{} have been described from local regions (Haussknecht 1884, Böcher 1962, Munz 1965). Small (1968) reported that tetraploids of \\i{}C. latifolium\\i0{} tend to have high percentages of 4-pored pollen, while the diploids usually have only 3-pored pollen. Small (1968) mapped the distribution of the races in the western hemisphere, indicating that all the collections from the Canadian Arctic Archipelago appear to be diploid. The races appear to form worldwide, allopatric ecogeographic phases. A high level of quadrivalent formation observed during tetraploid meiosis indicated that the tetraploids arose by autopolyploidy. Small (1968) stated that the tetraploids in \\i{}C. latifolium\\i0{} are undoubtedly autotetraploids, as the polyploids and diploids are almost indistinguishable morphologically. The distinctiveness of \\i{}C. latifolium\\i0{} within its genus make it highly unlikely that the tetraploids arose by allopolyploidy. Since distinctive phases are not found among the diploid populations, the origin of the tetraploid from hybridisation between different diploid races of \\i{}C. latifolium\\i0{} is very unlikely. This led Small (1968) to recommend that the races not be given formal taxonomic recognition. \\par{}Mosquin and Small (1971, p. 680, 681) considered that \\i{}C. angustifolium\\i0{} and \\i{}C. latifolium \\i0{}represent an example of parallel evolution and that \"although the two species are closely related, evidence indicates that they are isolated by ecological and genetic barriers.

Damaged shoots showed effective compensation, producing between 89 and 583% more branch tissue than undamaged shoots, but as clumps of shoots are joined by perennial rhizomes; a single year of herbivore damage to a clump\u0027s shoots reduced net growth by more than 75% over a 3-year period. Clump form also changed following attack. In the year after damage, shoot numbers were reduced by 51%, while mean shoot size either increased or was unaffected. Further complicating the caterpillar\u0027s impact on its host was its inhibition of mammalian herbivory; simulated caterpillar damage reduced the probability of mammalian attack from 20 to 6%. Doak (1991) concluded that these complicated and very different changes following herbivory illustrate the need to study compensation mechanistically and in the context of plant\u0027s biotic environment in order to understand its importance and consequences.\u003e","\u003cSamuelsson (1922) based the original description of this species on collections from Siberia, Novaya Zemlya, and Greenland, and provided a photograph of pressed plants to illustrate the species he was describing. \\par{}Hoch (unpublished) considers \\i{}E. arcticum\\i0{} to be restricted to North America, in northern Alaska, NWT (especially the former Franklin Territory), Canadian Arctic Archipelago, and Greenland north of 70°N.

He considered that none of these populations could be consistently grouped into subgroups distinctive enough to warrant taxonomic recognition at the species level, so it seemed wisest, and certainly most practical, to recognise a single polymorphic species.\\par{}Recent DNA sequence data provide strong evidence that \\i{}Braya glabella\\i0{} is an allopolyploid that includes genomic contributions from both the \\i{}B. pilosa\\i0{}/\\i{}B. thorild-wulffii\\i0{} and the \\i{}B. humilis\\i0{}/\\i{}B. linearis\\i0{}/\\i{}B. alpina\\i0{} lineages. Perhaps it has arisen several times in several different places, as has been demonstrated in some allopolyploid \\i{}Draba\\i0{} species.\\par{}\\i{}Braya glabella\\i0{} is extremely variable throughout its range. Multiple origins and non-uniform genomic contributions from parental lineages could account for the morphological variability in \\i{}B. glabella\\i0{}. Local pockets of variation have at times been recognised at the species, subspecies, and variety levels, but most of these taxonomic designations break down when the complex patterns of variation from the entire range of \\i{}B. glabella\\i0{} are considered. However, populations of \\i{}B. glabella\\i0{} from High Arctic regions are usually distinguishable from those from lower arctic and subarctic montane populations, and they are recognised here as subsp. \\i{}purpurascens\\i0{} and subsp. \\i{}glabella\\i0{}, respectively. Some populations on southern islands in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and along the northern coast of continental North America will defy unequivocal placement.\\par{}Key to subspecies. \\par{}1a.\\tab{}Fruits oblong to narrowly oblong-lanceolate, 3.5-8.3 times longer than broad; mature fruiting inflorescences often loosely elongated; plants of lower arctic, subarctic, and montane distribution....subsp. \\i{}glabella\\i0{} \\par{}1b.\\tab{}Fruits ovoid-ellipsoid to oblong-ellipsoid (rarely broadly oblong-lanceolate), 2.5-3.7 times longer than broad; mature fruiting inflorescences often densely compact; plants mostly of High Arctic distribution, south to the northern coast of continental North America...subsp. \\i{}purpurascens\\i0{} \\par{}Harris (1985) noted that \\i{}Braya glabella\\i0{} Richards. is perhaps the most poorly understood \\i{}Braya\\i0{} species. It is extremely variable from one population to another, and to some extent, even within populations. Previous authors have split the species into several taxa on the basis of differences in silique shape and pubescence, style length, stigma breadth and lobing, leaf shape and dentation, and inflorescence length. While it is true that many populations of \\i{}B. glabella\\i0{} appear to be strikingly distinct on the basis of these attributes, when a large number of specimens are examined from throughout the entire range of distribution the perceived morphological gaps quickly blur into a bewildering array of overlapping forms. Richardson\u0027s original collections of \\i{}Braya glabella\\i0{} and the original collections of Brown\u0027s \\i{}Platypetalum purpurascens\\i0{} happen to fall near the opposite edges of the spectrum of diversity in the species. It is not at all surprising that Brown (1823, 1824), as well as the overwhelming majority of subsequent authors, recognised the two taxa as separate and distinct species; indeed, the type specimens of \\i{}B. glabella\\i0{} and \\i{}P. purpurascens\\i0{} appear to be very different. But, when the entire range of variation is observed, the two morphological forms flow together to the point that it is impossible to draw a sharp boundary line between them. Abbe (1948) commented on the range of variation to be found in this group even within a single population. He and his wife collected 58 individuals from a population at Richmond (E.C. and L.B. Abbe 3819) and found that the plants ranged from specimens that fell very nicely within the range of variation of \"typical\" \\i{}Braya purpurascens\\i0{} as described by Brown (1823) and illustrated by Hooker (1830, Tab. XXIII) \"...into the robust type of specimen from Southampton Island...\" Had Abbe had access to authentic fruiting material of \\i{}B. glabella\\i0{}, he almost certainly would have realised that the robust specimens from Southampton Island (for example, Malte 120677) are near perfect matches for \"typical\" \\i{}B. glabella\\i0{}. This, in fact, appears to be the pattern in the group; specimens from the North American High Arctic are more or less \\i{}B. purpurascens\\i0{}-like, and plants from lower arctic, subarctic, and montane regions are generally more \\i{}B. glabella\\i0{}-like, but it is almost always possible to find plants in any population that look somewhat out of place and approach, morphologically, plants of the alternate morphological form. The populations on and near the northern coast of continental North America appear to be in the zone of overlap, and it is here that the greatest difficulty is encountered in attempting to segregate specimens into one or the other of the two forms. This is especially true in disturbed areas, where normally inbreeding, isolated populations come together as they move onto the newly available habitats, gene flow again begins to take place, and plants from the same population may exhibit an extreme range of diversity. On the basis of morphological and molecular evidence, it is difficult to justify the recognition of more than one species in this very plastic group, but it does seem desirable to divide the species into two rather weak subspecies. Many populations will be readily separable into one of these subspecies, but other populations will undoubtedly defy unequivocal placement, particularly those from areas where the ranges of the subspecies meet. Harris (1985) also noted that Abbe (1948), even with very limited material to work with, realised the close relationship between \\i{}Braya glabella\\i0{} and \\i{}B. purpurascens\\i0{} and became suspicious that the two might comprise a single species: \"There is no evidence against \\i{}Braya glabella\\i0{} of Richardson being conspecific with \\i{}B. purpurascens\\i0{} (R. Brown) Bunge. The chief difficulty is the lack of positive evidence concerning the nature of the mature siliques and of their arrangement on the scape. Should these support the possibility that the two are conspecific, then the name \\i{}B. glabella\\i0{} would have to be substituted for \\i{}B. purpurascens\\i0{}.\" It appears that \\i{}B. glabella\\i0{} and \\i{}B. purpurascens\\i0{} are indeed conspecific and warrant recognition only at the infraspecific level. Because the epithet \"\\i{}glabella\\i0{}\" (Richardson 1823) was validly published before the epithet \"\\i{}purpurascens\\i0{}\" (Brown1823), \\i{}B. glabella\\i0{} has nomenclatural priority over \\i{}B. purpurascens\\i0{}.\u003e","\u003cSee under \\i{}B. glabella\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}glabella\\i0{} for a discussion of the species and its infraspecific taxa.\\par{}Elven et al. (2003) noted that Rollins (1993) synonymised \\i{}B. glabella\\i0{}, \\i{}B. purpurascens\\i0{} (and \\i{}B. henryae\\i0{}), and \\i{}B. bartlettiana\\i0{} without any arguments and without reference to other authors. It is difficult both to object to and to accept his point of view without comparison of types of all four entities. \\par{}Harris (1985), after examining the types of all four entities, considered \\i{}B. henryae\\i0{} and \\i{}B. bartlettiana\\i0{} to be synonyms of \\i{}B. glabella\\i0{} var. \\i{}glabella\\i0{}, and recognised \\i{}B. purpurascens\\i0{} as a variety of \\i{}B. glabella\\i0{}. \\par{}\\i{}Braya henryae\\i0{} was accepted as a species by Porsild and Cody (1980), who commented that perhaps it should be considered a geographical race of \\i{}B. purpurascens.\\i0{}\u003e","\u003cHarris (1985) separated the two varieties of \\i{}B. humilis\\i0{} in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago as follows: \\par{}1a. Siliques 1.2-1.8 mm wide, not torulose; stems simple, becoming prostrate in fruit; plants of northern Ellesmere Island... \\b{}var. \\i{}ellesmerensis\\i0{} \\par{}\\b0{}1b. Siliques 0.6-1.1(-1.3) mm wide, usually more or less torulose; stems simple or branches, ascending to erect; plants of various distributions.

In order to explain the present-day distribution of \\i{}Braya\\i0{} in North America, it is necessary to postulate the survival of segments of the population in unglaciated areas to the north and south of the ice-sheet as well as in localised refugial areas that escaped glaciation even though surrounded by ice. \\par{}Harris (1985) superimposed the distribution of \\i{}B. humilis\\i0{} on the map, showing the approximate limits of the granitic bedrock in the eastern Canadian Shield. He noted the sharply defined distribution limits of \\i{}B. humilis\\i0{} in Ontario and Manitoba and suggested that this indicated the inability of this species to invade regions of granitic soils. \\par{}Acceptance of \\i{}Neotorularia\\i0{}, as distinct from \\i{}Braya\\i0{}, was proposed in the work of Hedge and Léonard, in Léonard (1986) and Al-Shehbaz et al. (1999), Novon 9: 296-307. In an arctic context, it consists of entities within what has been named \\i{}Braya humilis\\i0{} and 1-2 close relatives, entities accepted by Rollins (1993) within his concept of \\i{}B. humilis\\i0{}. \\par{}The genus name \\i{}Torularia\\i0{} (Coss.) O.E. Schulz was proposed conserved for this genus [Taxon 31: 754, 1982], but this proposal was rejected [see Taxon 34: 661, 1985]. More recent DNA evidence has suggested that \\i{}B. humilis\\i0{} belongs with other \\i{}Braya\\i0{} species, and it is to be so treated in the \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{} treatment (Al-Shehbaz, personal communication, Dec. 2003). \\par{}The writing of Harris (1985) on this taxon noted that the plants have a tendency to form small populations of fairly uniform individuals, which are each somewhat different from the next population, but may be quite similar to some distant populations. He thought this may be due to several factors, suggesting the following: \\par{}1. Hexaploid populations probably often arise through hybridisation of tetraploid and octoploid populations. It appeared to Harris (1985) that hybridisation in different areas may have produced hexaploids which bear some morphological characteristics attributable to ploidy level. Mulligan (1965) noted that hexaploids are more variable than tetraploids and octoploids in style length, pod size, and life span, but most often differences in chromosome number are not accompanied by obvious morphological differences. \\par{}2. Some morphological similarities between distant populations may be caused by the establishment of one or a few individuals and subsequent inbreeding of similar alleles in different populations that become fixed. Although this may account for some long-distance interpopulation similarities, paradoxically, it is probably this same process of genetic depletion and fixation, postulated and demonstrated in many groups of flowering plants (Stebbins 1942, 1957, Solbrig 1972, Soltis 1982), that is most responsible for the distinctiveness of many \\i{}B. humilis\\i0{} populations. \\par{}\\i{}Braya humilis\\i0{} forms a highly variable polyploid complex that has confounded generations of botanists. The long list of synonyms attests to the taxonomic difficulties in the group. In the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, however, most populations fall comfortably within a broad concept of \\i{}B. humilis\\i0{}. One exception are populations with prostrate to decumbent stems, exceptionally wide siliques, and fenestrate septae from northern Ellesmere Island that may deserve infraspecific recognition (Harris 2004).\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Braya thorild-wulffii\\i0{} differs from \\i{}B. purpurascens\\i0{} in several morphological characters and in ploidy level. Plants from Wrangel Island are confirmed as belonging to this species and are geographically connected to the \u0027type\u0027 area in Greenland by later finds through Arctic Canada. It is treated as a distinct species (Petrovsky, Murray, and Elven, in Elven et al. 2003). \\par{}Populations of \\i{}Braya thorild-wulffii\\i0{} on Banks and Victoria Islands have essentially glabrous stems, inflorescences, and fruits, in striking contrast to the densely hairy plants from more northerly populations. This glabrous form may merit infraspecific recognition (Harris, unpublished, 2005).\u003e","","\u003cThis species is unproblematical, even if the names that have been applied have been widely discussed (see Elven et al. 2003). \\par{}Elven et al. (2005) supplied the following information.\\par{}\\b\\i{}Cardamine digitata\\b0\\i0{} Richardson. \"This characteristic plant was described from northwestern Canada: Mackenzie district.

However, Lamarck described his species as \\i{}Dentaria digitata\\i0{}, not as a \\i{}Cardamine\\i0{}. \\i{}Cardamine hyperborea\\i0{} is therefore based on the same type as \\i{}C. digitata\\i0{} and is a superfluous synonym, as already pointed out by Shetler (1961) and Rollins (1993) and confirmed by Egorova (in a personal communication to Elven, 2004): \"\\i{}Cardamine hyperborea\\i0{} is a nomen superfluvum illegitimum [for \\i{}C. digitata\\i0{} Richardson] according to Art. 52, 1-52.2 of the St. Louis Code\".\" \\par{}\\b\\i{}Cardamine richardsonii\\i0{} \\b0{}Hultén. \"Hultén (1945) coined this name to replace \\i{}C. digitata\\i0{} Richardson, as he also, on the authority of Schulz, erroneously assumed that Richardson\u0027s name was predated by Lamarck\u0027s \\i{}\u0027digitata\u0027\\i0{} and that \\i{}C. hyperborea\\i0{} belonged to the broad-leaved plants.

I can find no important difference. \"Some of the American plants named as subsp. \\i{}angustifolia\\i0{} differ from the more broad-leaved Eurasiatic ones, but similar narrow-leaved plants occur also on the European side (for example, in northern Scandinavian mountains, see Lövkvist 1956, Nilsson 1986). Broad-leaved plants, indistinguishable from the Svalbard and Scandinavian ones, are found as frequent in arctic Canada. I think we have one and only one widespread arctic race.\" (Elven in Elven et al. 2003).\u003e","\u003cThe generic name \\i{}Cochlearia\\i0{} comes from the Greek \\i{}cochlear\\i0{}, a spoon, in reference to the spoon-shaped basal leaves, which also are responsible for the common name of spoonwort. However, in Europe the basal rosette leaves of \\i{}C. officinalis\\i0{} (as opposed to the leaves on the stem) are typically heart-shaped, not spoon-shaped as in the closely related \\i{}C. anglica\\i0{} L. (Wyse Jackson, personal communication, 1999). \\par{}Huxley et al. (1992) noted that, as might be expected with such a widespread plant, \\i{}Cochlearia officinalis\\i0{} s.l. is very variable, having races with different chromosome numbers, and requiring taxonomic study (Scoggan 1979, Rich 1991). \\par{}Elven et al. (2005) noted that the name \\i{}\u0027C. officinalis\u0027\\i0{} is connected to the tetraploids. In an arctic context, these are restricted to, and exclusively in, mainland northwestern Europe, whereas all other areas (including ours) have diploids. The arctic diploids differ from the tetraploids in very few characters, the most pronounced being (1) smaller flowers, and (2) lack of the distinct honey smell of \\i{}C. officinalis\\i0{}. Elven et al. (2003) observed that it is disputed whether all arctic diploids belong within one species. However, plants from Svalbard, Iceland, Greenland, northernmost arctic North America, and northernmost arctic Siberia conform morphologically with \\i{}C. groenlandica\\i0{}. Elven et al. (2005) suggested that this taxon should be accepted at the level of species; we use this name here. The arguments in favour of a species solution are as follows: (a) consistent ploidy difference (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 14 verses 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 24); (b) total reproductive barrier; no hybrids or intermediates have ever been documented; (c) indications that the tetraploid \\i{}C. officinalis\\i0{} is either an auto- or an allopolyploid from diploid parental species (European ones) fully different from \\i{}C. groenlandica\\i0{}; (d) consistent morphological differences, albeit small ones; and (e) parapatric to nearly allopatric ranges.\\par{}Scurvy grass is a biennial, rarely a perennial, although normally cultivated as an annual. In its first year it forms a low rosette (basal cluster) of leaves. In the spring of the second year, it produces a flowering stalk about 30 cm in height with small white flowers. The plant continues to flower into summer. Dwarfed plants may have stems that are only 5 cm long, while the stems of robust plants may be as long as 35 cm (Rollins 1993).\\par{}Maessen et al. (1983) studied resource allocation strategies for a range of vascular plant species growing in a High Arctic lowland oasis, located adjacent to Alexandra Fjord, Ellesmere Island, and Nunavut. Species as \\i{}Cochlearia\\i0{} and \\i{}Draba (groenlandica) oblongata\\i0{}, which occupied disturbed habitats, had a large proportion of resources allocated to sexual reproductive tissue.\u003e","","\u003cWithin the genus, this species has been placed in Ser. \\b\\i{}Alpinae\\b0\\i0{} Tolm. in Kom., Fl. SSSR, 8: 391.1929. The \\i{}Draba alpina\\i0{} aggregate is composed of \\i{}D. aleutica\\i0{}, \\i{}D. alpina\\i0{}, \\i{}D. corymbosa\\i0{}, \\i{}D. glacialis\\i0{}, ?\\i{}D. macounii\\i0{}, \\i{}D. ochroleuca\\i0{}, \\i{}D. oxycarpa\\i0{}, \\i{}D. pohlei\\i0{},\\i{} \\i0{}and some others.\\par{}Typification of \\i{}D. alpina\\i0{} is important because this name has been applied indiscriminately for most yellow-flowered drabas throughout the Arctic and sometimes applied contrary to both possible interpretations of Linnaeus\u0027 concept. The lectotypification reserves the name for the decaploid (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 80) entity, which since the time of Linnaeus has been considered under this name in the European and North Atlantic areas. In other areas, the name has sometimes been applied differently. The most evident case is Löve and Löve (1975), reserving the name \u0027\\i{}D. alpina\\i0{} L. s.s.\u0027 for the octoploid level (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 64). Most of the octoploid reports that the Löves (Heilborn 1927, Jørgensen et al. 1958, Löve and Löve 1961d, Knaben and Engelskjøn 1967, Löve 1970a) refer to are \\i{}D. oxycarpa\\i0{} Sommerf. \\par{}The distribution of \\i{}D. alpina\\i0{} in the restricted (and Linnaean) meaning is unclear. Material from the North Atlantic area (northeastern Canada, Greenland, Svalbard, northern Fennoscandia, northern Russia) corresponds well with it. It is much more uncertain in northwestern America, Russian Far East, and Siberia. These problems cannot be solved without a circumpolar revision of the yellow-flowered drabas. Recently, Elven (personal communication 2007) has suggested that this species may be restricted to the eastern-most parts of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, reaching Hudson Bay but not further west.\\par{}Brochmann et al. (1993) investigated 101 populations of Nordic \\i{}Draba\\i0{} for chromosome numbers and crossing relationships. The chromosome data suggested that all the populations and species are homoploid. \\i{}Draba alpina\\i0{} is a decaploid, and the complex is probably polyphyletic. The relationships found from crossing data largely agreed with those inferred from earlier published molecular data, but corresponded poorly to relationships inferred from morphology. \\par{}Brochmann (1992b) found that seed size and colour distinguished species in this complex. Brochmann et al. (1993) concluded that \\i{}D. alpina\\i0{} is probably polyphyletic and that this complex and the morphologically similar polyploid \\i{}D. oxycarpa\\i0{} do not have any diploid progenitors in common.\u003e","\u003cThis species was included in \\i{}D. cinerea\\i0{} in Flora Europea. During a visit to Canada in May, 2003, Elven separated many sheets of this species from among collections at CAN and DAO, most of which had previously been filed as \\i{}Draba cinerea\\i0{}. Elven et al. (2003) noted that, morphologically and cytologically, this taxon is distinct from \\i{}D. cinerea\\i0{} s.s. There are also consistent differences in genetic markers (Brochmann et al. 1992a, 1992c, 1993; Andersen et al. 1999; Andersen 2002). In recent decades this species has been accepted in Greenland, Svalbard, and partly in Russia, Siberia. In North America it was still included by implication in \\i{}D. cinerea\\i0{} by Porsild and Cody (1980), Rollins (1993), and Cody (1996). The distribution in North America is therefore much less well known than in other areas. The treatment presented here is provisional pending further study.\\par{}The Greenland entity \\i{}\u0027ostenfeldii\u0027\\i0{} described and accepted by Ekman and Böcher was tentatively treated as a subspecies by Elven et al. (2003). Both Böcher (1966) and Andersen et al. (1999) found consistent differences between subsp. \\i{}ostenfeldii\\i0{} and \\i{}D. arctica\\i0{} s.s. that may justify treatment as a subspecies even if they are sympatric and both are decaploid. Species rank is out of the question for these \u0027close\u0027 entities, and there is no ecological difference that could justify ecotypical varieties. \\par{}Elven (personal communication, 2005) noted that \\i{}Draba arctica\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}ostenfeldii\\i0{} is also relevant for the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, as it was described from northeastern Canada in addition to northwestern Greenland. Three syntypes are cited: northwestern Greenland: Thule, Saunders\u0027 Island, 1914, leg. P.Freuchen (C); northwestern Greenland: Thule, \"det høje Land paa Vejen til Uvdle\", 1917, leg. Th.Wulff (C); and northwestern Canada: Ellesmere I., \"sinu Goose Fjord\", leg. H.G. Simmons 2894 (C, isotype in O).\\par{}Andersen (2003) studied morphological and isoenzymatic variation in \\i{}Draba arctica\\i0{} and its relatives in the North Atlantic region and concluded that the patterns of variation do not indicate any taxonomic heterogeneity. The Svalbard plants belong to subsp. \\i{}arctica\\i0{} as currently understood, but there is need for a lectotypification of \\i{}D. arctica\\i0{} to make the application of this name unambiguous. Morphological evidence found species rank appropriate for at least \\i{}D. glabella\\i0{},\\i{} D. cinerea\\i0{},\\i{} D. arctica\\i0{},\\i{} \\i0{}and \\i{}D. arctogena/norvegica\\i0{}. For the first three, there is a supporting correspondence between evidence from cytology (ploidy levels), morphology, and genetic markers (isoenzymes) even if \\i{}D. arctica\\i0{} and \\i{}D. cinerea\\i0{} are more closely related than these two are to \\i{}D. glabella.\\i0{}\u003e","\u003cElven, in May 2003, when he visited Canada, drew attention to the presence of this species among \\i{}Draba\\i0{} specimens at both CAN and DAO, many of them previously filed under \\i{}D. oblongata.\\i0\\par{}The distribution is unclear. North American and northwestern European authors consider this a species of Greenland, northeastern North America, and perhaps Iceland, and the arctic Norwegian islands (Jan Mayen, Bear Island, Svalbard). Russian authors and Petrovsky (in Elven et al. 2003) indicate it as distributed throughout eastern Siberia and Russian Far East eastwards from Kharaulakh and into Alaska. Elven (personal communication, 2005) stated he had yet to see convincing specimens from outside the amphi-Atlantic regions.\\par{}The treatment presented here is provisional pending further study.\u003e","\u003cG.A. Mulligan annotated plants from Ferguson Lake on Victoria Island, 69°25\u0027N and 105°15\u0027W (CAN 561159, CAN 561455), as belonging to this taxon in 1968, and this record is mapped in Porsild and Cody (1980). A second record from Banks Island, Masik River, 71°37\u0027N, 123°06\u0027W (CAN 561469), was annotated by Mulligan the same year but not mapped in Porsild and Cody (1980).\u003e","\u003cThe map for this species is based on specimens annotated by Elven when he visited CAN and DAO in May 2003. \\par{}Elven et al. (2003) considered that the \\i{}Draba cinerea\\i0{} aggregate is composed of \\i{}D. arctica\\i0{}, \\i{}D. cinerea\\i0{}, \\i{}D. oblongata\\i0{}, \\i{}D. ovibovina\\i0{}, and \\i{}D. parvisiliquosa\\i0{}. \\par{}Elven (personal communication, 2005) noted that there are, as indicated, several possible types, and those in herbarium G-DC correspond excellently with our current concept of the species. He had collected the species in 2004 in the type area around the town of Schigansk. These plants are also similar to those in Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Fennoscandia.\\par{}In the North Atlantic areas, \\i{}D. cinerea\\i0{} is comparatively southern. It occurs in southern Greenland but not in the north. In the Nordic area it is restricted to the northern boreal parts of the mainland and is replaced by \\i{}D. arctica\\i0{} in Svalbard.\\par{}The treatment presented here is provisional pending further study.\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Draba corymbosa\\i0{} is a complex high-polyploid that may have received a large part of its genome, perhaps the majority, from other aggregates (perhaps the \\i{}D. cinerea\\i0{} and the \\i{}D. micropetala\\i0{} aggregates) (Elven et al. 2003).\\par{}Nearly all the material available for the typification (LE) of \\i{}Draba barbata\\i0{} [Pohle, Bull. Jard. Bot. Petétersb. 14: 467. 1914] fits into the current concept of \\i{}D. corymbosa\\i0{}. Its range from Taimyr, across Bering Strait, to Alaska is within that of \\i{}D. corymbosa\\i0{}, as is its high-polyploid chromosome number (more than 100, Zhukova and Petrovsky 1972, cited after Löve and Löve 1975).\\par{}Brochmann et al. (1992a-d) investigated this species as one of three morphologically variable Nordic species and their possible progenitors using enzyme electrophoresis and restriction site analysis of chloroplast DNA (cDNA) and nuclear ribosomal RNA (rDNA) genes. They found the electrophoretic data showed high levels of fixed heterozygosity in the three polyploid taxa, showing that they are all genetic alloploids. Electrophoretic and rDNA data suggest that \\i{}D. corymbosa\\i0{} is a polyphyletic polyploid. In experiments where plants were cross-pollinated the data also supported this conclusion. It is likely that \\i{}D. corymbosa\\i0{} is polyphyletic and that this species has formed numerous times in different areas. \\par{}Brochmann (1992b), in a study of pollen and seed morphology of Nordic \\i{}Draba\\i0{}, found that the pollen morphological data for \\i{}D. corymbosa\\i0{} are consistent with the hypothesis that this 16-ploid is an intersectional allopolyploid derived from species in the sections \\i{}Draba\\i0{} and \\i{}Chrysodraba\\i0{}. \\par{}Brochmann et al. (1993) suggested that \\i{}D. corymbosa\\i0{} is probably an intersectional, polyphyletic alloploid derived from \\i{}D. alpina\\i0{} (10\\i{}x\\i0{}) and various hexaploids of Sec. \\i{}Draba\\i0{}. \\par{}Ekman (1931) rejected the name \\i{}D. corymbosa\\i0{} because she found the type specimen of it (in BM) to be \\i{}Cochlearia fenestrata\\i0{} R. Br. This rejection was unjustified and was caused by different sheets and erroneous labelling. One of the sheets annotated by Brown contains a very typical and well-preserved \\i{}Cochlearia\\i0{} and is double-labelled \\i{}Cochlearia fenestrata\\i0{} and \\i{}Draba corymbosa\\i0{}. Another sheet, which Ekman probably did not see, contains a less well-preserved but \u0027typical\u0027 \\i{}D. corymbosa\\i0{}, as currently understood. It is annotated as such by Brown and was chosen as lectotype by Mulligan (1974).\u003e","","\u003cIn its entire geographical range \\i{}Draba fladnizensis\\i0{} is known to be diploid, 2\\i{}n \\i0{}\u003d 16. \\par{}The confusion between \\i{}D. fladnizensis\\i0{} and \\i{}D. lactea\\i0{} has been due to doubts about the latter species and name (see \\i{}D. lactea\\i0{} for discussion of its type). The two species are distinct, both morphologically and genetically, and \\i{}D. lactea\\i0{} is not closely related to \\i{}D. fladnizensis\\i0{} but rather to the amphi-Beringian \\i{}D. palanderiana\\i0{} Kjellm. (Grundt et al. 2005). \\par{}Brochmann et al. (1993) found interpopulational F1 hybrids in \\i{}D. fladnizensis\\i0{} to be entirely sterile, suggesting that this predominantly inbreeding diploid species comprises at least two sibling species, possibly isolated by genetic barriers. Crossing experiments within and between populations of \\i{}D. fladnizensis\\i0{} (Grundt et al. 2005) in a circumpolar range have subsequently documented extensive within-species incompatibility, i.e., the occurrence of very numerous sibling species.\\par{}\\i{}Draba subcapitata\\i0{} (in \\i{}Pilosae\\i0{}) and \\i{}D. fladnizensis\\i0{} (in \\i{}Lacteae\\i0{}) are genetically and morphologically close (Scheen 1999, Scheen et al. 2002) and must belong to the same series if the series shall have any taxonomic value. Both species are much more different from \\i{}D. lactea\\i0{} and from \\i{}D. pilosa\\i0{} than from each other. \\par{}Scheen et al. (2002) studied the delimitation of \\i{}D. lactea\\i0{} and \\i{}D. fladnizensis\\i0{} morphologically, enzymatically, and using DNA (RAPD) to test the hypothesis that the origin of \\i{}D. lactea\\i0{} (reported as a hexaploid) is possibly derived from the diploids \\i{}D. fladnizensis\\i0{}, \\i{}D. nivalis\\i0{} and (or) \\i{}D. subcapitata\\i0{}. In extensive analyses they found that the intrapopulational isozyme variation was low or absent, the diploids were almost invariably homozygous, and \\i{}D. lactea\\i0{} was highly fixed heterozygous. Multivariate analyses of the RAPD data revealed four very distinct groups of multilocus phenotypes. These groups also differed in several morphological characters and corresponded to the four tentative species. The species were less differentiated in isozyme loci, in particular the diploids \\i{}D. fladnizensis\\i0{} and \\i{}D. subcapitata\\i0{}, but \\i{}D. lactea\\i0{} was clearly distinguished from \\i{}D. fladnizensis\\i0{} based on all three data sets.\u003e","\u003cThis is a very common and variable species. It has large geographical and environmental ranges and responds with a wide range of growth forms and morphological variation. \\par{}Elven in Elven et al. (2003) noted that Russian sources almost uniformly have applied the name \\i{}D. hirta\\i0{} L. to this species, whereas that name has long been out of use in northwestern Europe and Greenland. They note that \"the material available for typification of \\i{}D. hirta\\i0{} L. is LINN 823.12 with two specimens. The left-hand plant is marked \"lapp\" (Lapland, i.e., northern Scandinavia), is in acceptable condition, and may perhaps belong to \\i{}D. glabella\\i0{} as currently understood [but this will be very difficult to decide absolutely]. The right-hand plant is in very bad condition and probably belongs to \\i{}D. norvegica\\i0{} as currently understood.\" There is little help in the protologue, and there is no indication that Linnaeus had this, and only this, species in mind. The name has been applied and misapplied to too many diverse specimens to have any current use. It is therefore to be rejected, as it is not possible to make an unambiguous typification. \\par{}The chromosome reports from Iceland (Löve and Löve 1956, 1975) are enigmatic, as the presence of this species in Iceland is discounted by Jalas et al. (1996) and Kristinsson (list, maps). The problem is that no octoploid \\i{}Draba\\i0{} is currently known from Iceland. Vouchers of Löve counts are notoriously difficult to find, and the problem may be unsolvable (Elven et al. 2003). \\par{}Decaploid counts have been found in northeastern Asia (Petrovsky, personal communication, May 2002). \\par{}Andersen (2003) found that \\i{}D. glabella\\i0{} (Series Hirtae) is distinct enzymatically and especially morphologically from both \\i{}D. arctica \\i0{}and \\i{}D. cinerea\\i0{}. In morphology, it is intermediate between these two species (Series Cinereae) and \\i{}D. arctogena\\i0{} (Series Rupestres). His results justify Tolmatchew (1939) separation of this complex into three series.\u003e","\u003cThis species is mainly hexaploid, but tetraploids are also known (Grundt et al. 2005b). The species has been hypothesised as originating from a cross between \\i{}D. fladnizensis\\i0{} and \\i{}D. nivalis\\i0{}, but molecular data (including cloning of ITS sequences) rather points towards only one parent, close to the present-day diploid amphi-Beringian species \\i{}D. palanderiana\\i0{} Kjellm. (Grundt et al. 2005). Natural hybrids between \\i{}D. lactea\\i0{} and \\i{}D. fladnizensis\\i0{} or \\i{}D. nivalis\\i0{} have never been proved, and artificial hybrids are sterile (Brochmann et al. 1993).\\par{}Populations collected from Alaska with tetraploid counts have been found to cluster together with hexaploid \\i{}lactea\\i0{} populations in a UPGMA analysis based on RAPDs (Random Amplified Polymorphic DNAs) (Grundt et al. 2005). There is reason to believe that tetraploid and hexaploid populations contain the same diploid ancestal genomes, and that the hexaploid populations simply have an extra copy of one of them. Thus, both should be contained within the same species (Grundt, personal communication, 2001). \\par{}Brochmann et al. (1992a-d) investigated this species as one of three morphologically variable Nordic species and their possible progenitors, using enzyme electrophoresis and restriction site analysis of chloroplast DNA (cDNA) and nuclear ribosomal RNA (rDNA) genes, and found the electrophoretic data showed high levels of fixed heterozygosity in the three polyploids, showing that they are all genetic alloploids. Electrophoretic and rDNA and pollen exine sculpturing data suggest that \\i{}D. lactea\\i0{} is a polyphyletic polyploid and likely to have formed numerous times in different areas. \\par{}Scheen et al. (2002) studied the delimitation of \\i{}D. lactea\\i0{} and \\i{}D. fladnizensis\\i0{} morphologically, enzymatically, and using DNA (RAPD) to test the hypothesis that the origin of \\i{}D. lactea\\i0{} (reported as a hexaploid) is possibly derived from the diploids \\i{}D. fladnizensis\\i0{}, \\i{}D. nivalis\\i0{} and (or) \\i{}D. subcapitata\\i0{}.

Contrary to earlier suggestions, the hexaploid \\i{}D. lactea\\i0{} was genetically more similar to \\i{}D. subcapitata\\i0{} than to \\i{}D. nivalis\\i0{}.\u003e","\u003cElven et al. (2003) noted that the \\i{}D\\i0{}. \\i{}micropetala\\i0{} aggregate is probably a natural group of taxa with very small and narrow pale yellow petals, very short styles, broad leaves with a rounded to subacute apex, and very coarse simple hairs and long-stalked branched hairs (forked, irregular, cruciform or few-branched stellate). Some of these features are also found in some more high-ploid species in the \\i{}D. alpina\\i0{} aggregate, especially in \\i{}D. corymbosa\\i0{}. The comparatively low-ploid \\i{}D. micropetala\\i0{} aggregate may have furnished genomes or share parts of the same genomic stock as do parts of the \\i{}D. alpina\\i0{} aggregate. \\par{}Most of the variation in Greenland, Svalbard, and northern Russia fits fairly well into two species: the hexaploid \\i{}D. micropetala\\i0{} Hooker and the tetraploid \\i{}D. pauciflora\\i0{} R.Br. The division is, however, less easy to apply on arctic American material (\\i{}D. micropetala and D. pauciflora\\i0{}; both names based on North American types). There may be more than two taxa involved, and also the ploidy differences might be less clear-cut than implied by the investigations made to date. A revision combined with genetical investigations is needed. Elven did a preliminary revision of Arctic Canadian specimens at CAN and DAO in 2003, and separated the material on three groups, two representing these two species and a third that he referred to at the time as \\i{}D.\\i0{} aff. \\i{}micropetala\\i0{}.\\par{}The majority of the decaploid chromosome counts (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 80), grouped by Löve and Löve (1975) under the name \\i{}D. micropetala\\i0{}, probably belong to \\i{}D. alpina\\i0{} L. s.s. Their reasons for this strange treatment are unknown. Elven et al. (2003) knew of no high-ploid chromosome count of the \u0027micropetalous\u0027 \\i{}Drabas\\i0{} and suggested that the octoploid chromosome counts (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 64) reported by Petrovsky in earlier drafts of the checklist might belong to \\i{}D. oblongata\\i0{} R. Br. s.s., i.e., not \\i{}D. micropetala\\i0{}. \\par{}The name \\i{}D. oblongata\\i0{} was for a long time applied for this species. It has been proved to belong to, and have priority for, a white-flowered species in ser. \\i{}Cinereae\\i0{}, later described and generally known as \\i{}D. groenlandica\\i0{} E. Ekman (see Mulligan 1974a). The first valid name for the species seems to be \\i{}D. micropetala\\i0{} Hooker (1825a). The lectotype of \\i{}D. micropetala\\i0{} (K) chosen by Mulligan is unambiguous.\u003e","\u003cThe \\i{}Draba nivalis\\i0{} aggregate consists of \\i{}D. kamtschatica\\i0{}, \\i{}D. lonchocarpa\\i0{}, \\i{}D. nivalis\\i0{}, \\i{}D. palanderiana\\i0{},\\i{} \\i0{}and possibly \\i{}D. magadanensis \\i0{}(Elven et al. 2003). The five species listed constitute a group of comparatively closely related low-ploids. The aggregate also contains several non-arctic species, e.g., the Cordilleran and tetraploid (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 32) \\i{}D. porsildii\\i0{} G.A. Mulligan that reaches north to non-arctic Yukon Territory and east-central Alaska. Only \\i{}D. nivalis\\i0{} is found in the Flora region.\\par{}\\i{}Draba nivalis\\i0{} is exclusively known as diploid with 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 16. The species is thought to be inbreeding (Brochmann 1993). The morphology of this species is not as straightforward as previously thought. \\i{}Draba nivalis\\i0{} with stellate hairs only on the leaf margins exists, and these individuals have frequently been confused with \\i{}D. lactea\\i0{} (e.g., see above). Populations being completely glabrous have also been found both from Alaska and Greenland. That they belong to the \\i{}nivalis\\i0{} taxon has been confirmed by RAPD analysis (Grundt et al. 2004), but they have most certainly been confused with \\i{}D. fladnizensis\\i0{}. Crossing experiments within populations of \\i{}D. nivalis\\i0{} (Grundt et al. 2005a) has shown that several of these populations are inter-sterile. \\par{}\\i{}Draba caesia\\i0{} Adams represents a synonym or a variety of \\i{}D. nivalis\\i0{}, and has wrongly been confused with \\i{}D. palanderaina\\i0{} Kjellm. especially by North American authors, according to Petrovsky (1971). Elven (personal communication, 2005) noted that he and Hanne Grundt had looked at all syntypes (original Adams collections) in G-DC and in both herbaria in Moscow. Each and every syntype belonged to \\i{}D. nivalis\\i0{}. Adams was probably unaware of \\i{}D. nivalis\\i0{} Lilj. when he described \\i{}D. caesia\\i0{}, as he never referred to it.\u003e","\u003cThis taxon is closely related to \\i{}D. arctogena\\i0{}, and intermediate plants are reported from Greenland (Böcher 1966a). The intermediates may represent the interbreeding of North Atlantic \\i{}\u0027D. norvegica\u0027\\i0{} and plants of \\i{}\u0027D. arctogena\u0027\\i0{} originally from Greenland and be parts of one polymorphic species. If this is so they may be best treated as subspecies. Russian authors identify \\i{}Draba arctogena\\i0{} in Canadian and Far East collections. The Canadian materials of the \\i{}D. norvegica\\i0{} group (including \\i{}D. arctogena\\i0{}) need to be revised. \\par{}Plants morphologically similar to, and preliminarily identified with, \\i{}D. norvegica\\i0{} have been repeatedly collected on Wrangel Island.

(2003) stated that whether the species occurs in northern Europe has been investigated, with the discovery (2001) of collections from northern Spitsbergen that resemble \\i{}D. oblongata\\i0{} in most characters. The site is inaccessible, and it was difficult to base a firm conclusion on the few specimens available. \\par{}There are specimens of this species from Siberia: Taimyr and Lena delta (Petrovsky, personal communication, 2002), and records of the plants in the lower Lena River region were confirmed in 2004 by Elven (personal communication, 2005).\\par{}Maessen et al.

(1973, from Siberia), and Mulligan (1974a, from Canada?), may also belong here, but this needs to be confirmed by examining the identity of the vouchers.\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Draba subcapitata\\i0{} is a diploid, 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d16. It is quite distinct morphologically, in indumentum, petal morphology, and silique shape and seems to be quite closely related to \\i{}D. fladnizensis\\i0{} (RAPD analysis; Grundt et al.2004). \\par{}\\i{}Draba subcapitata\\i0{} (in ser. \\i{}Pilosae\\i0{}) and \\i{}D. fladnizensis\\i0{} (in ser. \\i{}Lacteae\\i0{}) are genetically and morphologically close (Scheen 1999, Scheen et al. 2002) and must belong to the same series if the series shall have any taxonomic value. Both species are more different than \\i{}D. lactea\\i0{} and \\i{}D. pilosa\\i0{} than they are from each other (Elven et al. 2003). \\par{}Recent genetical investigations (Grundt 2001, unpublished) prove a close relationship between \\i{}D. subcapitata\\i0{}, \\i{}D. fladnizensis\\i0{}, and also the central Asian \\i{}D. altaica\\i0{} Bunge (this name was applied for the arctic plants before Simmons\u0027 publication of \\i{}D. subcapitata\\i0{}). If we apply the series concept, \\i{}D. subcapitata\\i0{} therefore belongs in ser. \\i{}Lacteae\\i0{} rather than ser. \\i{}Pilosae\\i0{} or ser. \\i{}\u0027Oblongatae\u0027\\i0{}. This is also supported by the studies of Scheen (1999) and Scheen et al. (1999, 2001), investigating morphology, enzymes, and RAPD (Grundt and Elven, personal communication, 2002).\u003e","\u003cThis species varies considerably in size depending upon its habitat. \\par{}\\i{}Erysimum pallasii\\i0{} is often found near bird-nesting areas, where the soil is rich in calcium and nitrogenous compounds. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial, and flowers only once in its lifetime (Burt 2000).\u003e","\u003cElven et al. (2003) noted that the growth form of this species varies depending upon the habitat. The infructescences are characteristically narrow, much elongated, and with the siliques widely spaced. From the Nordic experience, it is difficult to recognise the Alaskan plants as the same species. The wide morphological variation, and also the ploidy variation, indicates some structure that might be recognisable taxonomically (Elven, in Elven et al. 2003).\u003e","\u003cThis species has leaves that are often slightly cupped, with a single blunt tooth on each side. The leaves are covered by unusual stellate hairs (the hair has a single stalk with numerous branches, forming a flat, radiate wheel (or a \"sunburst\")), easily visible with a hand lens. The yellow flowers are borne in loose racemes at the end of several widely diverging flower stalks. The siliques (seedpods) are globular and resemble tiny balls each with the remnants of the style at the tip, hence the common name of bladderpod. \\par{}Larger specimens of this species were previously recognised as var. \\i{}scammanae\\i0{}, but Rollins (1993) has reduced this taxon to synonymy, as size seems to be a reflection of the habitat. \\par{}This species was transferred to the genus \\i{}Physaria\\i0{}, a small genus of plants endemic to an area near Colorado, by O\u0027Kane and Al-Shehbaz (2002), based on DNA evidence. Mulligan (personal communicaton, 2005) indicated that plant morphology and the morphology of the chromosomes do not support this transfer [Novon 12: 319-329. 2002], and this is to be followed in the \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{} treatment (Ihsan Al-Shehbaz , personal communication, Dec. 2003).\u003e","\u003cMaterial from an isolated site in Herschel Island, North Yukon, has been reinvestigated and found to have been misidentified (Mulligan, personal communication, Sept. 2002).\u003e","\u003cThe flowers are very fragrant. The range of variation in this species is unusually great, and the same variants occur in both the North American and Eurasian populations (Rollins 1993). This is reflected in the long list of synonyms. Elven et al. (2003) agreed with Rollins\u0027 (1993) evaluation that it is difficult, or even impossible, to make consistent subdivisions of this taxon. The differential characters appear throughout the range and often even within populations.\u003e","\u003cAfter Rollin\u0027s (1941) monograph of western North American \\i{}Arabis\\i0{}, North American authors referred \\i{}Arabis hookeri\\i0{} to the North American Cordilleran oligotypic genus \\i{}Halimolobus\\i0{} Tausch, comprising robust perennials (some of them sub-shrubs), densely pubescent with soft branched hairs (including siliques) and with very thin and long styles. Typical representatives of the genus \\i{}Halimolobus\\i0{} are \\i{}H. patula\\i0{} Tausch and \\i{}H. stricta\\i0{} Tausch (isotypes in LE!), whereas the Cordilleran \\i{}H. virgatus\\i0{} (Nutt.) O.E. Schulz is closely related to \\i{}H. mollis\\i0{} (according to Rollins 1941 and A.E. Porsild 1957) and may belong to the genus \\i{}Arabidopsis\\i0{} as well (Yurtsev, personal communication, 2001).\\par{}A high inter-population polymorphism is notable in this taxon, more or less similar throughout the range. \\i{}Transberginia (Arabidopsis [Beringia] bursifolia\\i0{}) and \\i{}A. mollis\\i0{} are both variable species, but the ranges of their variability are practically identical. Comparison of anatomical structure of some parts of siliques, kindly performed by E. Velitschkin, in plants from the lower reaches of Kolyma River (\\i{}A. bursifolia\\i0{}) and western Greenland (\\i{}A. mollis\\i0{}), revealed some distinctions, for example, in the shape of cells in the mechanical tissue of the inner walls of valves (almost round in \\i{}A. mollis\\i0{}, multiangular in \\i{}A. bursifolia\\i0{}), but it is not known if these distinctions are stable. Elven et al. (2003) chose to synonymise the taxa. \\par{}This species was recently found genetically distinct from both \\i{}Arabidopsis\\i0{} and \\i{}Halimolobus\\i0{} by Price et al. (2001) and assigned to its own genus \\i{}Beringia\\i0{}. \\par{}Their chosen name of the genus had to be changed because the name \\i{}Beringia\\i0{} belongs to an algal genus, described by P. Perestenko, Bot. Zhurn. 60: 1183. 1975. The name \\i{}Transberginia\\i0{} for the genus was published in Novon 13: 396. 2003. \\par{}Price et al.

Subspecies \\i{}lapponica\\i0{} is found in eastern North America from New England to Baffin Island and in Greenland, Iceland, Scotland, Scandinavia, and the western Soviet arctic and subarctic. Subspecies \\i{}obovata\\i0{} is found in eastern arctic and subarctic Siberia, Korea, Japan, Aleutian Islands, Alaska, and the Yukon.

(1996) studied the anatomy, morphology, and chemical composition of four \\i{}Empetrum\\i0{} species in northern Siberia, \\i{}E. hermaphroditum\\i0{}, \\i{}E. nigrum\\i0{}, \\i{}E. sibiricum\\i0{}, and \\i{}E. subholarcticum\\i0{}, and recognised three groups, \\i{}E. nigrum\\i0{}, \\i{}E. hermaphroditum\\i0{}, and \\i{}E. subholarcticum\\i0{}, on the basis of the flower sexuality. \\par{}Kudo et al. (1999) studied the effects of snow-melt timing on leaf traits (for five deciduous and five evergreen species), shoot growth, and leaf production (for five evergreen species) of tundra plants along a snow-melt gradient in an alpine snowbed in northern Sweden. In the two predominantly boreal evergreen species \\i{}Empetrum\\i0{} \\i{}nigrum\\i0{} and \\i{}Vaccinium vitis-idaea\\i0{}, leaf life span was negatively correlated with both annual leaf production and shoot growth, but there were no similar significant correlations for the other three, strictly arctic-alpine evergreen species that these authors studied. \\par{}\\b{}Phytochemistry.\\b0{} Kallio et al. (1984) found that in \\i{}E. nigrum \\i0{}the content of glucose was 2.8 ± 0.1 g/100 mL, fructose 2.6 ± 0.1 g/100 mL, and the sugar alcohol inositol 0.02 g/100 mL. Traces of galactose were identified. Sucrose was absent in all samples (less than 0.01 mg/100 mL). \\par{}Hethering et al. (1984) found no evidence to support the suggestion that lipids (triacylglycerols) play a major energy storage role in the leaves of alpine \\i{}E. nigrum\\i0{}. These authors suggested that the presence of a well-developed waxy cuticle might account for the high total lipid levels encountered in dwarf evergreen shrubs. \\par{}Puntari et al. (1985) extracted volatiles from the black berries of the crowberry, \\i{}Empetrum nigrum\\i0{}, with steam distillation and capillary GLC-MS analysis and found 33 volatile compounds, among which benzoic acids and benzyl alcohol were the main ones. Fifteen compounds known to exist in blueberries (bilberry, bog blueberry, and high-bush blueberry) were found in crowberry. Esters of hydroxy acids, which are most important and characteristic of bilberries, were totally absent, which explains the very mild aroma of crowberry that is otherwise similar to that of blueberries. \\par{}Saratikov et al. (1991) found anticonvulsive activity in an ethanol extract from the aboveground part of \\i{}E. nigrum\\i0{} and compared it with that of benzonal in experiments carried out on mice and rats. The extract exhibited anticonvulsive properties in the models of corazole-, camphor-, strychnine-, and nicotine-induced convulsions and at maximal electroshock. The extract prolongs the effects of sedation and exhibits moderate H-cholinolytic, hypothermic, and analgesic activity. \\par{}Matsuura et al. (1995) documented the occurrence of antibacterial and antifungal compounds in \\i{}Empetrum nigrum\\i0{}. \\par{}\\b{}Pollen morphology.\\b0{} The pollen grains of \\i{}Empetrum\\i0{} were studied using both light and electron microscopy by Warner and Chinnappa (1990). They found that the grains are the typical tetrad form of most Ericales and that \\i{}E. nigrum\\i0{} has tetrahedral tetrads with 12 compound costae. The tetrads of \\i{}E. nigrum\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}hermaphroditum\\i0{} are larger than those of subsp. \\i{}nigrum\\i0{} and possess 12-16 compound costae per tetrad, which the authors suggested is related to polyploidy. \\par{}\\b{}Cytology\\b0{}. In northern Europe, the distribution of the cytotypes, there named as \\i{}E. nigrum\\i0{} L. and \\i{}E. hermaphroditum, \\i0{}were mapped based on literature references and original data (Velluti et al. 1995). These authors showed that the diploid taxon \\i{}E. nigrum\\i0{}, 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 26, is mainly distributed in central Europe and is rare in the Alps. The tetraploid taxon \\i{}E. hermaphroditum\\i0{}, 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 52, has a more northern distribution and is frequent in the Alps and northern Apennines. In the geographic areas where both taxa are present, they are never simultaneously present in the same habitats. The diploid taxon is almost exclusively linked to peat-bogs, and the tetraploid taxon, to windy peaks with scarce and short-term snow cover. \\par{}\\b{}Wood anatomy.\\b0{} Carlquist (1989) analysed the wood and bark of 12 collections of the Empetraceae and found that the family has vessels that are somewhat angular in cross section, with scalariform perforation plates and scalariform to opposite vessel-ray pitting. Imperforate trachery elements are all trachieds. Axial parenchyma is sparse and not subdivided. Rays are characteristically uniseriate and composed of upright cells. Older stems have rays with both upright and procumbent cells. These features ally Empetraceae closely to Ericaceae and Epacridaceae. The narrow vessels are quite numerous per mm\\super{}2\\nosupersub{} and denote a high degree of wood xeromorphy. The growth rings and tracheids may also be indicative of adaptation to drought or physiological drought due to cold. The wood samples demonstrated the accepted criteria for paedomorphosis with rays composed of upright cells, non-conversion of the uniseriate rays to multiseriate or heterocellular rays, and a decrease in vessel element and tracheid length with age.\u003e","\u003cThis taxon and \\i{}A. rubra\\i0{} have been transferred to the genus \\i{}Arctous\\i0{}, following Wells (2000). \\par{}The plants flower early in the spring before the leaves unfold (Porsild 1957). Flowers are therefore rare on herbarium specimens (Aiken observation). Carolyn Mallory has photographed flowering plants on Baffin Island (see images). The edible fruits are shiny and blue-black when ripe, but have a rather insipid flavour (Porsild 1957).\u003e","\u003cThis taxon and \\i{}A. alpina\\i0{} are similar and best distinguished by the presence of hairs on the petioles and leaf margins in the later, and the larger leaves of \\i{}A. rubra\\i0{}.

The leaves of \\i{}A. alpina\\i0{} persist for several years\\i{};\\i0{} those of \\i{}A. rubra\\i0{} do not and when they fall they leave areas of leafless stem.

The plants are generally prostrate and have small leaves, but sometimes grow to 20 cm high, with stems 0.6 cm thick and much broader leaves. The plant seems always to flower and generally to set fruit in abundance, even in its most northerly localities. Whether or not the species regularly sets seed has not been established from specimens in the herbarium at the Canadian Museum of Nature. \\par{}Savile (1969) considered the interrelationships of \"\\i{}Ledum\\i0{}\" species and their rust parasites and found that the rust, \\i{}Chrysomyxa ledi\\i0{} var. \\i{}ledi,\\i0{} on \\i{}Ledum palustre\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}decumbens\\i0{} is morphologically distinct from \\i{}C. ledi\\i0{} var. \\i{}groenlandici\\i0{}, which occurs on \\i{}Ledum groenlandicum\\i0{} Oeder, and suggested that this supports a species-level distinction between the two \"\\i{}Ledum\" \\i0{}taxa. \\par{}In a study of the germination ecology of \\i{}L. palustre\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}decumbens\\i0{} and \\i{}L. groenlandicum\\i0{}, Karlin and Bliss (1983) concluded that although the taxa are closely related, they had significantly different rates of germination. They found 94.3% of the total germination occurred within 12 days for 1-month-old seeds of \\i{}L. palustre\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}decumbens\\i0{}, while the corresponding value for \\i{}R. groenlandicum \\i0{}was 36.4%. Both species were found to require light in order for the seeds to germinate, although the germination of \\i{}L. groenlandicum\\i0{} was reduced in far-red rich light regimes, while that of \\i{}L. palustre\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}decumbens\\i0{} was not. \\par{}Kudo (1995) studied the leaf traits and shoot performance of \\i{}L. palustre\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}decumbens\\i0{} in accordance with latitudinal change. He found that at the Arctic sites this species produced leaves having longer life spans, higher nitrogen concentration, and smaller size and specific leaf area when compared with leaves at the temperate mountain site. Although current leaf number and annual shoot growth were smaller, leaf dry mass per stem was larger at the arctic site than at the temperate one. At a taiga site, those traits were within the range of the other two sites, with the exception of leaf size and total leaf number per stem, which was largest at the taiga site. Leaf life span was negatively correlated to specific leaf area and annual leaf number per stem and positively correlated to leaf nitrogen concentration. Thus, with increasing latitude, \\i{}L. palustre\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}decumbens\\i0{} produced fewer but more costly leaves and retained them for longer.

These groups correspond to ploidy levels and named taxa and are also morphologically different in a few characters. The arctic plants and the majority of those of temperate high mountains constitute one major tetraploid group to which the name \\i{}\u0027microphyllum\u0027\\i0{} belongs, and probably also the name \\i{}\u0027gaultherioides\u0027\\i0{}.

Cranberries are extremely high in vitamin C, moderately high in vitamin A, and quite high in fibre and anthocyanins, all components that have health-giving qualities. Hippuric acid is an important medicinal constituent of the fruit. The metabolism of this compound produces low-pH urine, unlike most other fruits. Evidence was presented to show that lingonberry exhibits potential anticarcinogenic activity, as evaluated by in vitro screening tests (Bomser et al. 1996). \\par{}The epithet \\i{}vitis-idaea\\i0{} is Latin for grape of Mount Ida. There are two Mount Ida\\rquote{}s of classical Greek mythology, one in Crete, the other in Asia Minor. \\ldblquote{}A number of species are named after Mount Ida that do not actually grow in either location, and this includes the lingonberry. Not only is \\ldblquote{}grape of Mount Ida\\rdblquote{} a misnomer in this respect, but neither the fruit nor the plant resembles a grape. Subspecies \\i{}minus\\i0{}, the variety in the Arctic Archipelago, is appropriately named with the Latin word for \\ldblquote{}lesser,\\rdblquote{} indicative of its smaller stature and smaller berries compared to the European variety.\\rdblquote{} (Small et al. 2003, p. 61). \\par{}\\ldblquote{}\\ldblquote{}Lingonberry\\rdblquote{} (and variants such as lingenbery, lingberry, linberry, lingon, lingen) are derived from the Swedish word \\i{}lingon\\i0{}, meaning lingonberry.

While pleasantly tart and aromatic, the fruits may be bitter, especially when unripe. Although lingonberries may be eaten raw, most people think they are too bitter. The berries have been said to taste best if they overwinter and are eaten during the melting of the snow. Lingonberries are high in benzoic acid, resulting in a long shelf life - over 8 weeks under normal refrigeration. The very small seeds are not noticeable in the fruit or processed products. The fruit is usually made into a sauce. The berries are also used in preserves, jams, jellies, syrups, juice, candy, ice cream, pastries (especially bread and pies), condiments, and wines and liqueurs.\\rdblquote{} (p. 62). \\par{}\\b{}Non-Food Uses\\b0\\par{}\"In northern Europe, delivering mothers once drank a decoction of lingonberry to prevent bleeding.

Agriculture Canada.\u003e","\u003cElven and Murray in Elven et al. (2003) noted that Russian botanists have suggested that there are two taxa that should be treated as full species, \\i{}O. obtusata\\i0{} (Turcz.) H. Hara and \\i{}Orthilia secunda\\i0{} (L.) House. Aiken, Elven, and Murray in Elven et al. (2005) note that although northern Siberian plants of the \u0027\\i{}obtusata\\i0{}\u0027 entity are very different from European material of \u0027\\i{}secunda\\i0{}\u0027 s.s., in North America they are more difficult to separate. \\par{}Erich Haber, who worked extensively on the family (see references), indicated that he has never recognised any infraspecific taxa in \\i{}Orthilia\\i0{}. His North American experience is that there is considerable morphological variability in growth and leaf form, depending on prevailing ecological conditions. Plants range from quite robust, coriaceous-leaved multi-flowered individuals, when found in temperate, sandy coniferous woods, to very much reduced, depauperate specimens very low in stature, with thin rounded leaves and few flowers, when plants grow in moss in boreal or sheltered tundra habitats. This latter expression is referred to \\i{}O. secunda\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}obtusata\\i0{}. A complete range in intermediates occurs, and they can often be found growing close together in more or less the same habitats. These diminutive plants also occur in eastern North American cedar swamps and in poorly drained black spruce forests across the range of the species (Haber, personal communication, March 2002). \\par{}Because of the European distinctions, some recognition of taxa is considered appropriate. Thus, Elven and Murray (in Panarctic Flora checklist discussions, 2001, Elven et al. 2003, 2005) suggested recognising subspecies \\i{}Orthilia secunda\\i0{} (L.) House subsp. \\i{}secunda\\i0{} and \\i{}Orthilia secunda\\i0{} (L.) House subsp. \\i{}obtusata\\i0{} (Turcz.) Böcher.\u003e","\u003cHaber (personal communication, 2000) noted that Skvortsov (1980, 1981) had a broad concept of \\i{}P. rotundifolia\\i0{}, and considered this taxon to be the subspecies \\i{}P. rotundifolia\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}grandiflora\\i0{}. Elven et al. (2003) remarked that the various subspecies are easily recognisable and they follow a narrower concept recognizing this entity as \\i{}P. grandiflora\\i0{}, which we are following here. They also note that a critical revision is needed of the \\i{}P. rotundifolia\\i0{} aggregate on a circumpolar basis.\u003e","\u003cThe flowers are very fragrant. \\par{}This taxon is a northwestern North American endemic. Murray, in Elven et al. (2005) noted that Porsild (1966) felt there was, in addition to \\i{}P. alaskensis\\i0{}, a single, variable taxon in Alaska, Yukon, and elsewhere in Arctic Canada, and he chose the name \\i{}\u0027richardsonii\u0027\\i0{}. Murray agrees there is one taxon but suggests using the name \\i{}\u0027hoodii\u0027\\i0{},\\i{} \\i0{}stating, \"When specimens are examined from the area where only \\i{}P. hoodii\\i0{} is found (Wyoming), it is possible to see within a series the full range of morphs of what passes for \\i{}\u0027hoodii\u0027\\i0{} and \\i{}\u0027richardsonii\u0027\\i0{}. The differences among specimens are the kinds one would expect from environmental modifications. The extremes are distinct but linked by numerous transitional forms. The essential architecture of the leaves, upon which the taxonomy is heavily based, is unchanged whether growth is lax or condensed or the leaves long or short. Good \\i{}\u0027hoodii\u0027\\i0{} occurs on terraces of the Porcupine River (northeastern Alaska) in open stands of white spruce and good \\i{}\u0027richardsonii\u0027\\i0{} grows just metres away on the steep, dry slopes above. Plants in arctic Northwest Territories are indistinguishable from those in alpine Yukon.\" This has led us to use the name \\i{}P. hoodii\\i0{}.\u003e","\u003cElven et al. (2003) noted that the \\i{}\u0027hyperboreum\u0027\\i0{} taxon is synonymised with \\i{}P. boreale\\i0{} by Tzvelev [in Fl. Arct. URSS 8. 1980] but separated as a subsp. \\i{}hyperboreum\\i0{} of \\i{}P. pulcherrimum\\i0{} by Löve and Löve (1975) and as a separate species by Hultén (1968b). \\par{}The names \\i{}\u0027hyperboreum\u0027\\i0{} and \\i{}\u0027humile\u0027\\i0{} are synonyms of \\i{}P. boreale\\i0{} (Petrovsky, personal communication, May 2000).\u003e","\u003cAlthough the name subsp. \u0027\\i{}arctisibirica\\i0{}\u0027 has been used for this taxon, \u0027\\i{}andersonii\\i0{}\u0027 has priority at subsp. rank (Elven et al. 2005).\u003e","\u003cElven et al. (2003) noted that \"the arctic plants differ appreciably from the northern European ones. As Linnaeus described the plant from Lapland (Sweden) and Russia (European part), the type should be from northern Europe. \\par{}...There have been several attempts to describe varieties, but none of them very successful\" (Elven et al. 2003). \\par{}\"The best way to deal with the plasticity inherent in this species may be to consider it all a single polymorphic taxon. No morphological distinctions, which hold up even at a population level, have been found, and the plants are really prone to environmental responses. Seeds from alpine (also arctic) morphs, which are short and few-flowered, become larger and lusher and produce many more flowers when grown in different locations. This plasticity, probably coupled with its very high level of selfing, as an annual, leads to much variation, but probably none of it is of taxonomic significance\" (S. Kelso, personal communication, 1999, to Elven et al. 2003).\u003e","\u003cElven et al. (2003) noted that \"the taxon \\i{}Primula stricta\\i0{} belongs to an aggregate (\\i{}P. anvilensis\\i0{}, \\i{}P. borealis\\i0{}, \\i{}P. incana\\i0{}, \\i{}P. laurentiana\\i0{}, \\i{}P. mistassinica\\i0{}, \\i{}P. stricta\\i0{}). The relations between these species are comparatively clear, but they constitute an evident aggregate, as they have often been mistaken for each other; see Porsild and Cody (1980) [compared with Kelso] (1991b) for the Hudson-Labrador area, Hultén (1968) [compared with] Kelso (1991b) for Alaska-Yukon.\" \\par{}Kelso (1991b) concluded that \\i{}P. stricta\\i0{} does not occur in Alaska. The westernmost [arctic American] location is at the Mackenzie River delta - all the (unfortunately) many reports for this species in Alaska have been based on misidentifications of other species. The only records found at CAN are two from near Holman, Victoria Island. Records from Banks Island in Porsild (1957) have not yet been found.\u003e","","\u003cThe arctic race \\i{}\u0027tenella\u0027\\i0{} is morphologically distinct from the more southern \\i{}\u0027maritima\u0027\\i0{} in the North Atlantic area and from subsp. \\i{}asiatica\\i0{} [Takeda (1911), J. Bot. (Tokyo) 49: 222], in the North Pacific area. The latter does not seem to really approach the Arctic even if there is a question mark for Chukchi Peninsula in Hultén (1968b). The arctic race is also genetically distinct from the North Atlantic one. Elven (personal communication, 2005) noted that subsp. \\i{}tenella\\i0{} has an arctic circumpolar distribution. Most of the arctic plants are morphologically distinct from varieties that have a more southern distribution. The following characters that differentiate the subspecies were given by Elven in Lid \u0026 Lid (2005):\\par{}\\i{}\u0027\\b{}maritima\\b0{}\u0027\\i0{} leaves ovate, apex subacute to slightly acuminate, on relatively short petioles; calyx segments triangular, becomes distinctly larger during fruit maturation (c. 3.5 × 2.8 mm) and broadly cordate and acuminate; corolla 5-6 mm long, segments triangular to cordate, acute; \\par{}\\b\\i{}\u0027tenella\u0027\\b0\\i0{} leaves broadly spathulate, apex rounded or obtuse with a short, well-defined point; calyx segments ovate to narrowly cordate, do not increase much during fruit maturation (c. 2 × 1 mm); corolla 4-5 mm long, segments rounded, obtuse or subobtuse. These plants have been named as var. \\i{}tenella\\i0{} (described from Svalbard) and occur from Svalbard and Jan Mayen across Greenland, Arctic Canada, and arctic Alaska, to arctic Russian Far East (Kolyma). They represent a major geographical race and deserve recognition as a subspecies. Supspecies \\i{}tenella\\i0{} is also quite distinct from the North Atlantic subsp. \\i{}maritima\\i0{} in molecular markers. Skarpås (1999, 2003) found total identity in isoenzymes in subsp. \\i{}maritima\\i0{} from southernmost to northernmost mainland Norway and distinct differences from arctic (Svalbard) material of var. \\i{}tenella\\i0{}.\u003e","\u003cThis is a colonising species of dry sunny slopes and herbmats. It is easily recognised by the larger terminal flowers, with pointed petal tips. Gillett (1957) reported that he climbed Mt. Caribou in the Yukon and observed that plants decreased in size without any apparent break in the population continuity, so that plant size could not be used to recognise more than one taxon.\\par{}Elven (personal communication, 2005) indicated that if subspecies are recognised the plants found in the Arctic Islands belong to\\i{}Gentianella propinqua\\i0{} (Richardson) J.M. Gillett subsp. \\i{}arctophila\\i0{} (Griseb.) Tzvelev, whereas subsp. \\i{}propinqua\\i0{} is found on the mainland, partly very close to the islands from Cape Bathurst to Coronation Gulf. \\par{}\u003e","\u003cGillett (1963) noted that this species also occurs in northern Europe and Asia. In the southern parts of these continents, it is found in the mountains. With the exception of a small population from the Pribilof Islands, Alaska, described as subsp.\\i{} pribilofii\\i0{} J.M. Gillett, all American material is subsp. \\i{}tenella\\i0{}. Gillett (1963) suggested that collectors often overlook this species because it can be mistaken for \\i{}Gentianella propinqua\\i0{}, which may explain the scattered distribution records.\u003e","\u003cThis is a readily recognised species in the Canadian Arctic Islands. With reference to Alaskan plants, Elven et al. (2003) noted that Cody (1996) accepted two races: the coastal subsp. \\i{}rotatum\\i0{} and the inland subsp. \\i{}tenuifolium\\i0{} (Griseb.) A.E. Porsild. The latter is found only in western North America and reaches the Arctic in northern Yukon Territory. The plant drawn for Hultén (1968b) obviously is of this inland type. In April 2001, Murray and Elven looked through the inland material in ALA from Alaska and Yukon and found no consistent differences. Some of the inland plants differ appreciably from the coastal ones, others did not. No consistent differences between coastal and inland plants were found.\u003e","\u003cIn northern Norway, this entity occurs quite independent of its proposed parents, rarely in company with any of them and distinctly outside the range of \\i{}H. tetraphylla\\i0{}. Elven has seen the same in some western Alaskan sites. It is intermediate between \\i{}H. tetraphylla\\i0{} and \\i{}H. vulgaris\\i0{}, but whether it is of hybrid origin has not been fully established (Elven, personal communication, 2002). \\par{}In the 1970s the Belgian botanist L. Vanhecke revised much of the northern materials of \\i{}Hippuris\\i0{}. Two sheets from the Arctic islands in O were redetermined as \\i{}H. lanceolata\\i0{}, from Southampton Island (Coral Harbour, leg. W.J. Cody, 24/7 1948) and from Baffin Island (Mallik Island, leg. R. Hainault and R. Norman, 10/8 1970). Elven re-examined these specimens and wondered if they were plants of \\i{}H. vulgaris\\i0{}, possibly in brackish waters. However, when he examined the images of plants photographed at Coral Harbour Southampton Island, 2001, he was convinced that they were \\i{}H. ×lanceolata\\i0{}. This resulted in Aiken re-examining all collections at CAN from the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and establishing that most of them are \\i{}H. ×lanceolata\\i0{}, a few are \\i{}H. vulgaris\\i0{}, and there were none of \\i{}H. tetraphylla\\i0{} from the islands, although it does occur as far north as Tuktoyaktuk.\u003e","\u003cWith a bit of imagination the tops of the plant sticking up above the water look like a tail of a horse, or more likely a donkey (Burt 2000). Ducks feed on mare\u0027s tail, and it is used as a potherb or cooked in chowders by wild-food enthusiasts, but it has been described as tasting very green (Schofield 1989). \"The Inupiat and Yupik of Alaska cook it in water with seal oil and add seal blood to make a soup. The Inuit of the Central Arctic do not use it.\" (Burt 2000, p. 44). \\par{}Gloschenko and Martini (1987), in a study made of the vegetation of four river-influenced coastal marshes located between the Moose River and Harricanaw River in southern James Bay, found six major grouping of species. These included (1) a salt marsh dominated by \\i{}Puccinellia phryganodes\\i0{}, \\i{}P. lucida\\i0{}, \\i{}Hippuris tetraphylla\\i0{}, and \\i{}Scirpus maritimus\\i0{}; (2) saline ponds with \\i{}Senecio congestus\\i0{}; (3) a saline/brackish meadow marsh with \\i{}Carex paleacea\\i0{}; (4) an intertidal estuarine marsh with \\i{}Eleocharis palustris\\i0{}; (5) freshwater ponds with\\i{} Potamogeton filiformis\\i0{}; and (6) a freshwater marsh/fen. Major environmental factors controlling the distribution of these groups include substrate salinity, river flow patterns, storm surges, and tidal range. These marshes are unique in species composition in James Bay.\u003e","\u003cCasper (1962) provided a revision of the genus \\i{}Pinguicula\\i0{} in Europe. Karlsson (1986), working in Sweden, found that plants of \\i{}P. vulgaris\\i0{} had annual roots representing about 5-10% of their biomass, but no correlation was found between the size of the reproductive organs and the size of the overwintering buds. The numbers of seeds produced per capsule varied from 110 to 140.\u003e","\u003c\\b{}Roots \\par{}\\b0{}Musselman and Rich (1976) found that in Iceland, \\i{}B. alpina\\i0{} parasitises \\i{}Carex\\i0{} species, \\i{}Persicaria\\i0{} (\\i{}Bistorta) vivipara\\i0{}, and almost certainly numerous other vascular plants. Haustoria are small in diameter (0.1 to 1.0 mm), have a reduced vascular core, and few (to 10) axial strands. Root hairs and a root cap are present on roots. \\par{}Nilsson and Svensson (1997) studied the host affiliation in \\i{}Bartsia alpina\\i0{} and \\i{}Pedicularis lapponica\\i0{} using visual examination of root connections and C14 labelling to identify host ranges of these two hemi-parasitic angiosperms. In total, 18 host species belonging to 11 families were found. Most of the hosts were members of the Cyperaceae. Both hemi-parasites formed connections with \\i{}Pinguicula vulgaris\\i0{}, which has a very small and stunted root system compared with the root system of larger plants such as \\i{}Betula\\i0{} species. The conclusion was that the mere presence of another species growing close to a hemi-parasitic plant does not mean that this plant is used as a host. \\par{}\\i{}Bartsia alpina\\i0{} was one of the species in the Jonasson and Callaghan (1992) study of root mechanical properties related to disturbed and stressed habitats. They found the roots of dwarf shrubs and forbs had significantly higher resilience than graminoids and the highest tensile strengths. Forbs showed the lowest values for all of the measured variables except for resilience, which fell between the values of graminoids and dwarf shrubs. \\par{}\\b{}Pollination and mating systems\\b0{} \\par{}Molau et al. (1989a), studying a northern Swedish population of \\i{}B. alpina\\i0{} that is pollinated by bumblebees, found it to have a mixed mating system. Deposition of self-pollen did not occur without pollinator intervention, and outcrossing was further promoted by pollen carry-over, adaptive post-pollination floral changes, and by selective resource allocation to seeds resulting from cross-pollination. Multiple paternity apparently dominated in natural pollinations. \\par{}Kwak and Bergman (1996) observed the early flowers of \\i{}B. alpina\\i0{} and the visitation by bumblebees in northern Sweden to find causes for low seed set in early flowers where bumblebees are the only visitors. They found that flowering of \\i{}B. alpina\\i0{} started simultaneously with \\i{}Astragalus frigidus\\i0{}, while \\i{}Pedicularis lapponica\\i0{} was nearly out of flowers. Early blooming flowers of \\i{}Bartsia\\i0{} received fewer visits than later blooming ones. The large volumes of nectar with a high sugar concentration in early flowers indicate that bumblebees neglect or fail to discover early blooming flowers of \\i{}Bartsia\\i0{}. Early in the season seven bumblebees species visited \\i{}Bartsia\\i0{} but later on \\i{}Bombus pascuorum\\i0{} was dominant. \\par{}\\b{}Seeds\\b0{} \\par{}Molau (1991) studied genetic variation in \\i{}Bartsia alpina\\i0{} for the maternal and paternal effects on seed size and reproductive success (RS) and assessed the impact of environmental factors in fertilisation and in defoliation experiments. Maternal effects on seed weight were much larger than paternal effects, and seed weight was also strongly influenced by resource availability (especially nitrogen). Defoliation experiments revealed an innate minimum seed weight, below which seed number was affected by resource deprivation. The reciprocal crossing program indicated a high level of gender specialisation in individual genets, ranging continuously from almost pure males to almost pure females. \\par{}Molau et al. (1989b) studied pre-dispersal seed predation in \\i{}B. alpina\\i0{} in a northern Swedish population and found that it suffered high levels of pre-dispersal seed predation by larvae of two insect species, both specialists on rhinanthoid Scrophulariaceae hosts. The primary predator is \\i{}Aethes deutschiana\\i0{} (epidoptera-Tortricidae), the host of which was previously unknown. The other predator is \\i{}Gimnomera dorsata\\i0{} (Diptera-Scatophagidae), which is basically a \\i{}Pedicularis\\i0{} specialist. \\par{}\\b{}Chemical composition\\b0{} \\par{}Cuendet et al. (1999) found \\i{}B. alpina\\i0{} had three iridoid glucosides, two phenylpropanoid derivatives and one flavonoid in methanolic whole plant extract. These authors found that some of the compounds have radical scavenging activity against DPPH or antioxidant activity against beta-carotene on TLC bioassay. \\par{}Bergström and Bergström (1989) collected volatile compounds from the inflorescences of individual \\i{}B. alpina\\i0{} plants in sub-alpine and alpine populations, and analysed them by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The compounds detected were alpha-pinene, Z-3-hexenol, Z-3-hexenyl acetate, phenyl acetaldehyde, and phenyl acetonitrile.\u003e","","\u003cPolunin (1940) noted that \\ldblquote{}taken in the broad sense this is an atrocious \\i{}typus polymorphus;\\i0{} treated otherwise it becomes a whole series of supposed species and subspecies which at least to those, who like myself, are unable to understand them, appear to intergrade so freely as to be in most cases quite untenable as separate taxonomic units.\\rdblquote\\par{}Polunin (1940) was aware of one specimen collected on Baffin Island, from the north shore of Frobisher Bay, by Professor Samuel C. Palmer in 1929, Philadelphia 642379. It appears to be the first and only collection of the species in the Arctic Archipelago.\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Euphrasia disjuncta\\i0{} Fernald and Wiegand [Rhodora 17: 190. 1915] is restricted to northeastern North America (with a parallel species, \\i{}E. subarctica\\i0{} Raup, in northwestern North America), typified from Newfoundland [Canada: western Newfoundland, Grand Falls, Valley of Exploits River, 12.08.1911, leg.\\i{} M.L. Fernald, K.M. Wiegand and H.T. Darlington 6169\\i0{} (GH) holotype], and widely distributed. The major parts of the range mapped by Porsild and Cody (1980) belong to this species. It is characterised by flowering at high nodes, small to intermediate, white-lilac flowers, leaves crenate, with many simple hairs but with an admixture of long multicellular glandular hairs, the calyx is fairly hairy. The type specimens have these characters, but in the same population (type sheet) are plants, with and without, glandular hairs. A syntype from Blanc Sablon Quebec (31.07.1910, leg. \\i{}Fernald and Wiegand\\i0{}) has the same characters.\\par{}Polunin (1940) recognised var. \\i{}minutissima\\i0{} Polunin, stating it includes specimens from Wakeham Bay collected in 1927 by Dr. Malte and distributed as \\i{}E. oakesii\\i0{} var. \\i{}Wettstein\\i0{}, which even if they had rather blunt bracts, suggestive of the latter species, were clearly seen to belong to the \\i{}E. arctica \\i0{}series on boiling out a flower, when the previously shrivelled corolla showed itself to be about 5 mm long and to have the upper lip quite deeply lobed. Polunin (1940) noted that his variety is apparently limited to the eastern half of the extreme south, where it is quite general in the mainland regions of Quebec and northernmost Labrador, and also occurs in Baffin northwards to near the Arctic Circle. Polunin (1940) also noted that the species often occur in great numbers, but is so diminutive that it has to be looked for to be found. It flowers and fruits abundantly except in places where the growing season is shortened by the late melting of the snow; here, being a summer annual, it is unable to persist. \\par{}Elven et al. (2003) noted that this taxon is characterised by flowers born at middle to high nodes, small to intermediate-sized, white-lilac flowers, leaves crenate, with many simple hairs mixed with long multicellular glandular hairs, and a fairly hairy calyx. The type specimens confirm with these characters, but in the same population (type sheet) are plants both with and without glandular hairs. A syntype from Blanc Sablon (31.07.1910, leg. Fernald and Wiegand) has the same characters.\\par{}Elven (personal communication, 2005) noted that Hultén (1968a, 1968b) tentatively synonymised the western \\i{}E. subarctica\\i0{} and the eastern \\i{}E. disjuncta\\i0{} under the latter name. The arctic Alaskan plants belong to \\i{}\u0027subarctica\u0027\\i0{}, the arctic northeastern Canadian plants to \\i{}\u0027disjuncta\u0027\\i0{}. Morphologically, \\i{}E. subarctica\\i0{} is different from both \\i{}E. disjuncta\\i0{} and another eastern species, \\i{}E. hudsoniana\\i0{}. At anthesis \\i{}E. subarctica\\i0{} is very prolonged with first flowers at high nodes, very small yellowish flowers (white-lilac ones in \\i{}E. disjuncta\\i0{}), and a dominance in the indumentum of long multicellular glandular hairs. The plants from Northwest Territory are less glandular than those from further west. The type originates from the more eastern parts of the range, but Raup (in comment with the description) identified \\i{}E. subarctica\\i0{} with the Fairbanks (Alaska) plants, i.e., with the western entity. Therefore, synonymizing these two species is not recommended.\u003e","\u003cElven (personal communication, 2005) noted that the name \\i{}E. wettsteinii\\i0{} is the only name that certainly belongs to the widespread, small-flowered, and non-glandular, broadly amphi-atlantic plant that occurs on Baffin Island. \\par{}In addition to \\i{}E. wettsteinii\\i0{} and \\i{}E. disjuncta\\i0{} there are three species reported from nearby areas. \\i{}Euphrasia vinacea\\i0{} P.D. Sell and Yeo [Feddes Repert. 64: 203. 1962] is a \"Hudsonian\" endemic typified from Churchill on Hudson Bay. It is considered closely related to \\i{}E. wettsteinii\\i0{} and is tentatively reported also from arctic Labrador. \\i{}Euphrasia hudsonica\\i0{} Fernald and Wiegand [Rhodora 17: 194. 1915] was described from Ungava [Canada: Ungava, Spreadborough, Koaksoak River, 08.1896, leg.\\i{} M.L. Fernald and K.M. Wiegand\\i0{} (GH) holotype] and occurs as arctic at least in North Labrador (Nain), Ungava, and along Hudson Bay. It is characterised by first flowers from comparatively low nodes (4-6), leaves more or less sharply dentate, flowers comparatively large, white-lilac, more hairy than most other northern entities but with only eglandular hairs, conspicuously long hairs on the leaves and calyx compared with European entities, the calyx with blackish spots (as in \\i{}E. wettsteinii\\i0{}), and each capsule more or less equals its calyx in length. A third species, also characterised by often abundant, glandular hairs is \\i{}Euphrasia frigida\\i0{} Pugsley (as typified, J. Linn. Soc., Bot. 48: 490. 1930) in much of South and Central Greenland. One or more of these species might occur also in the Arctic Islands.\u003e","\u003cMolau and Murray (1996) noted that this species is found in a broad band across the Arctic from European Russia to Thule, Greenland (Bay 1993). It is an Arctic species for most of its range, but it also occurs within taiga in alpine sites as in the mountains of central Alaska. Typical forms with their sharply contrasting purple helmet and pure white corolla lip are immediately distinguishable from all other species.\u003e","\u003cMolau and Murray (1996) noted that this species has been considered an endemic of the western Russian Arctic, however, they considered the species extends from northernmost Siberia and the Russian Far East eastward across Alaska, to Sachs Harbour on Banks Island and Cape Bathurst on the mainland in western Arctic Canada, not much beyond the western extent of the Laurentide Ice sheet of Wisonsinan time; that is, its distribution in North America is barely beyond the boundary of the Eastern Beringian refugium. These authors stated that characteristically each plant gives rise to several bow-shaped shoots, thus this habit and the yellowish white lanate, capitate inflorescence generally distinguish this species in the field from its morphological relatives.\\par{}\u003e","\u003cPolunin (1940) stated that this is an attractive and quite unmistakable species, even if in our area it varies in the size of the corolla and number of flowers to the inflorescence. Large plants may be 15 cm high, but in the far north plants are usually 5-6 cm high. However, a specimen collected by General Greely, from Northern Ellesmere Island in the Gray herbarium, is robust and nearly 10 cm high. Polunin (1940) considered this species \\ldblquote{}western\\rdblquote{} in affinity like \\i{}P. sudetica\\i0{}, but noted that \\i{}P. capitata\\i0{} has spread farther than the later species and occurs in northwest Greenland and southwest Baffin. \\par{}Williams and Batzlli (1982) found \\i{}P. capitata\\i0{} to be a mid-season blooming species of \\i{}Pedicularis\\i0{} that when compared with four other species in a study done in Alaska had relatively few flowers, and thus few seeds per shoot, even though nectar production and pollination success were high.\u003e","\u003cPolunin (1940) stated this well-marked and rather peculiar species, common almost throughout the most southern parts of our area, varies little except in size and luxuriance, the characteristic mature fruiting axes being anywhere from 6 to 20 cm high. The post-flowering growth of this species is particularly conspicuous, as the stem, in addition to increasing in length, also increases rather considerably in thickness. \\par{}Polunin (1940) named \\i{}f. flavescens \\i0{}based on a single plant seen at Kimmirut in 1936. It had flowers with pale yellow corollas. The species is normally dark brown towards the base. Flowers do not have a scent.\u003e","\u003cIn northwestern Greenland and on Ellesmere and Baffin islands, a form intermediate between \\i{}P. hirsuta\\i0{} and \\i{}P. langsdorffii\\i0{} (\\i{}arctica\\i0{}) is found. It has the general habit of \\i{}P. hirsuta\\i0{} but has the larger flower and minutely dentate helmet of \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} (Porsild 1957). \\par{}Elven (personal communication, 2005) commented that hybrids between any (northern) \\i{}Pedicularis \\i0{}species have not been proved, even if small and/or large plants are sometimes misinterpreted as such. The occurrence of such intermediates should therefore be thoroughly documented before the concept is accepted.\\par{}Freytag and Weber (1987) found that the hemi-parasites \\i{}Pedicularis lapponica\\i0{} and \\i{}P. hirsuta\\i0{} are not host specific but preferred hosts in the genus \\i{}Salix\\i0{}, owing to their frequent occurrence in the habitat of the \\i{}Pedicularis\\i0{} species or possibly because of stimulation from the ectomycorrhizal roots of the \\i{}Salix\\i0{} plants. These \\i{}Pedicularis\\i0{} species do not seriously injure the host\u0027s roots. Development of the \\i{}Pedicularis \\i0{}haustoria and the morphological-anatomical structures are typical for members of the \\i{}Rhinanthoideae\\i0{}. In respect to the xylem system of the haustorium, these species showed differences when compared with middle European \\i{}Pedicularis\\i0{} species. The xylem system has much more volume, which is a result of procambium-like cells that are derivatives of the pericycle. \\par{}This is reported to be one of 2-3 species of \\i{}Pedicularis\\i0{} that occur north of the distribution of bumblebees. Fly pollination in species of \\i{}Pedicularis \\i0{}was observed by MacInnes (1972) and documented in specimens deposited in the Agriculture Canada, Department of Entomology, collection (MacInnes, personal communication).\u003e","\u003cPolunin (1940) stated that this characteristic species had been collected only three times in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, one on the \"Chidley Peninsula, 60-60.30°N\" and twice some miles inland of Lake Harbour. The species is plentiful to the south of the archipelago where it shows a considerable range of variation in such purely vegetative characters as general robustness and the amount of branching. Some specimens growing in boggy situations at Churchill are referable to \\i{}f. simplex\\i0{} (Hultén) Polunin (\\i{}Pedicularis euphrasiodes\\i0{} var. \\i{}simplex\\i0{} Hultén in Kungl. Sv.

(2003) considered the \\i{}Pedicularis lanata\\i0{} aggregate included \\i{}P. alopecuroides\\i0{}, \\i{}P. dasyantha\\i0{}, and \\i{}P. lanata\\i0{} and noted the three entities are allopatric or parapatric and not very different morphologically. They considered treating the taxa as subspecies as an alternative. That was done by Hultén (1971) who recognised \\i{}P. kanei\\i0{} subspp. \\i{}dasyantha\\i0{}, \\i{}adamsii\\i0{} and \\i{}lanata\\i0{}. The oldest species name in the group is \\i{}\u0027alopecuroides\u0027\\i0{}, not \\i{}\u0027lanata\u0027\\i0{} (Elven et al. 2003).\\par{}Polunin (1940) consider this \"perhaps the most handsome of all High Arctic plants, with its tall woolly spike of bright pink flowers and its fat yellow root, which pulls up so easily and which, even if its taste is somewhat earthy, I have on occasion been very glad to find. It is one of the few tolerably palatable plants in these inhospitable regions.... It is conspicuous and characteristic and not to be confused with any other species in the field, even if in herbaria it has sometimes proved difficult to separate from [\\i{}P. langsdorffii\\i0{}]\"...It is one of the first flowers to appear when the snow melts, and although the uppermost blossoms on the rapidly elongating spike come out many days after the lowest, they [do not flower for long] and hence are missed by most summer visitors.\" (p. 332)\\par{}Philipp (1998) studied four closely related species of \\i{}Pedicularis\\i0{} within a limited area of Greenland (\\i{}P. flammea\\i0{}, \\i{}hirsuta\\i0{}, \\i{}lanata\\i0{}, and \\i{}lapponica\\i0{}). The species chosen have different breeding systems and they were analysed for amount and distribution of genetic variation at three sites at Qeqertarsuaq, West Greenland. Isozyme variation was present in two enzyme systems (phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and phosphoglucomutase) in \\i{}P. lanata\\i0{}. Average genetic diversity (He) was 0.028, including monomorphic loci. Compared to the other three species investigated, \\i{}P. lanata\\i0{} had the breeding system with the highest capacity for outcrossing in the study area and also showed the greatest morphological variation within its geographic distribution. Thus, there seems to be accordance between the morphological variation, breeding system, and the population genetic results. \\par{}Williams and Batzlli (1982) found \\i{}P\\i0{}. (\\i{}kanei\\i0{}) \\i{}lanata\\i0{} bloomed earlier than the four other species that are common near Atkasook, Alaska, and rely on bumblebees for pollination. This early species had the largest shoots and produced many seeds even though nectar production and pollination success (seeds per ovule) were low.\u003e","\u003cElven et al. (2003) noted that there might be a question of priority of the name, as both \\i{}P. langsdorffii\\i0{} and \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} are published in 1823. The priority of \\i{}P. langsdorffii\\i0{} is probably accepted because of the assumption that \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} first was published in \u0027Bot. App.\u0027 in 1824. A possible type of \\i{}P. arctica\\i0{} is \"\\i{}Pedicularis arctica\\i0{} Melville Island, [1819-1820], leg. E. Sabine (BM)\". \\par{}\\i{}Pedicularis langsdorffii\\i0{} is a tall and robust plant of the northern Pacific regions. Plants in the Arctic Archipelago differ in often being more lanate, having a shorter spike, and generally broader rachis to the leaf. The flowers also tend to be smaller, but the differences are not consistent. Polunin (1940) suggested that the Arctic Archipelago plants be called \\i{}P. langsdorffii\\i0{} var. \\i{}arctica\\i0{} (R. Br.) Polunin. Whether there are sufficient consistent distinctions to recognise this variety, and two others suggested by Russian researcher Ivanina in her treatment for Elven et al. (2003), was being discussed (R. Elven, personal communication, 2001). \\par{}Polunin (1940) stated that the very \\i{}P. hirsuta\\i0{}-like habit of this species is well illustrated by Simmons (1906, pl. 2). Indeed it has often been confused with \\i{}P. hirsuta\\i0{} particularly in the south of the Arctic Archipelago. However, the unusually large, dark purple, conspicuously spreading and clearly bidentate flowers of the far northern plants identify them with \\i{}P. langsdorffii\\i0{}. \\par{}Williams and Batzlli (1982), in a study of five species of \\i{}Pedicularis\\i0{} that are common near Atkasook, Alaska, and rely on bumblebees for pollination, found \\i{}P\\i0{}. \\i{}langsdorffii\\i0{} had large numbers of ovules, high pollination success, and the largest number of seeds per shoot.\u003e","\u003cPolunin (1940) commented that this delightful species, which in Lapland is sometimes almost the only bright flower to be seen in miles of parched, lichen-birch-scrub, is plentiful and apparently without marked variation in the southern parts of the Arctic Archipelago where it flowers abundantly and generally manages to ripen fruit. In Canada it grows in rather dry, heath areas, being supposedly parasitic on the roots of the dominant ground-shrubs. It also grows in the less swampy parts of marshes. The plants are generally gregarious and propagate by long, slender runners. \\par{}Porsild (1957) described the helmet as prolonged into a long beak, and the image library illustrates the snorkel-hood-like end to the helmet petals. Mayer (1972), in describing the species in \\i{}Flora Europaea\\i0{}, described the beak as rather short, which may be the case when this species is compared with other species that occur in northern Europe. \\par{}The flowers are very fragrant. \\par{}MacInnes and Cavers (1971) reported on the reproduction of this species in Nunavut, at McConnell River, 60°50\u0027N, 94°25\u0027W, after a study that lasted 3-4 years. They found the average number of seeds per plant, per reproductive attempt, was 8 for this species, approximately 2% of the estimated potential output. Inadequate pollination was suggested as the problem, as \\i{}P. lapponica\\i0{} did not set seed in insect exclusion experiments. Of the reproductive attempt 23% of some flowers, capsules, ovules, and developing seeds were destroyed by insects and other animals. \\par{}Nilsson and Svensson (1997) studied the host affiliation in \\i{}Bartsia alpina\\i0{} and \\i{}Pedicularis lapponica\\i0{} using visual examination of root connections and C14 labelling to identify host ranges of these two hemi-parasitic angiosperms. They found that labelling with C14 was more sensitive than root examination, since seven additional host species and three new host families were found using the former method. In total, 18 host species belonging to 11 families were found. Most of the hosts were members of the Cyperacea. Not all species tested using C14 labelling were found to be hosts, and there was no preference for host species with large root systems. Both hemi-parasites formed connections with \\i{}Pinguicula vulgaris\\i0{}, which has a very small and stunted root system compared with the root system of larger plants such as \\i{}Betula\\i0{} species. The conclusion was that the mere presence of another species growing close to a hemi-parasitic plant does not mean that this plant is used as a host. \\par{}Freytag and Weber (1987) found that \\i{}Pedicularis lapponica\\i0{} and \\i{}P. hirsuta\\i0{} are not host specific. Preferred hosts are \\i{}Salix\\i0{} species, owing to their frequent occurrence in the habitat of the \\i{}Pedicularis\\i0{} species or a possible stimulation from the ectomycorrhizal roots of the \\i{}Salix\\i0{} plants. These \\i{}Pedicularis \\i0{}species do not show serious injury at the host roots. All parasitic roots are able to attack host roots. Development of the \\i{}Pedicularis\\i0{} haustoria and the morphological-anatomical structures are typical for the \\i{}Rhinanthoideae\\i0{}. Just in respect to the xylem system of the haustorium, these species showed differences when compared with middle European \\i{}Pedicularis\\i0{} species: The xylem system has much more volume, which is a result of procambium-like cells that are derivatives of the pericycle. \\par{}Williams and Batzlli (1982), in a study of five species of \\i{}Pedicularis\\i0{} at Atkasook, Alaska, which rely on bumblebees for pollination, found \\i{}P. lapponica\\i0{} had the smallest shoots and produced few seeds even though pollination success was high.\u003e","\u003cIf subspecies are recognised, the specimens from the Canadian Arctic are subspecies \\i{}wormskjoldii\\i0{}. \\par{}The taxonomic consequences of the variation in this species have a convoluted history that revolves around geographical patterns and ploidy level, as follows:\\par{}Hultén (1968b) recognised two entities in North America: the wide-ranging subsp. \\i{}wormskjoldii\\i0{} from Greenland west to Alaska, and the Cordilleran subsp. \\i{}alterniflora\\i0{} from California to Alaska where it reaches the Arctic in the Brooks Range. These were not accepted by Cody (1996). Hultén synonymised Bongard\u0027s \\i{}V. nutans\\i0{} with subsp. \\i{}wormskjoldii\\i0{}. However, after a ploidy variation was documented in the 1960\u0027s, Löve and Löve (1975) separated the northwestern American plants as a diploid \\i{}V. nutans\\i0{} from the northeastern American tetraploid \\i{}V. wormskjoldii\\i0{} s.s. They did not mention the \\i{}\u0027alterniflora\u0027\\i0{} entity, and it is not clear whether all the northwestern American plants belong in their \\i{}V. nutans\\i0{}. \\par{}The differences reported between the races or species are small and mainly quantitative. Elven et al. (2003) debated whether to recognise them as distinct taxa or to keep a collective species. The options for separate entities appeared to be as follows:\\par{}\"(a) As an eastern and western species. \\i{}Veronica wormskjoldii\\i0{}, restricted to Greenland and eastern Canada, and the western \\i{}V. nutans\\i0{}, found in western Canada and Alaska. The western species would include both subsp. \\i{}alterniflora\\i0{} and the western part of subsp. \\i{}wormskjoldii\\i0{} in Hultén\u0027s meaning. \\par{}(b) Similar to the above, recognising two subspecies: subsp. \\i{}wormskjoldii\\i0{}, the eastern entity; subsp. \\i{}alterniflora\\i0{} (with the \\i{}\u0027nutans\u0027\\i0{} names as synonyms), the western entity. Elven et al. (2003) felt that both solutions (a) and (b) neglect the morphological variation found among the western plants. \\par{}(c) As Hultén (1968b), with a wide subsp. \\i{}wormskjoldii\\i0{} and a Cordilleran subsp. \\i{}alterniflora\\i0{}. Such a solution probably neglects the ploidy difference between eastern and western plants. \\par{}(d) As three entities, perhaps represented by the names \\i{}\u0027wormskjoldii\u0027\\i0{} (eastern tetraploid entity, Greenland typification, Canada and Greenland), \\i{}\u0027nutans\u0027\\i0{} (western coastal, perhaps diploid entity, southeastern Alaskan typification, ALA), and \\i{}\u0027alterniflora\u0027\\i0{} (western Cordilleran, probably diploid entity, Canadian Rockies typification, ALA).\"\u003e","\u003cThe infraspecific variation is appreciable and treated in different ways in different traditions. In North America, only diploid counts have been reported from the Arctic. In Greenland, Böcher et al. (1978) recognised the plants as \\i{}C. gieseckiana\\i0{} with two races, the widely distributed diploid (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 34) as subsp. \\i{}gieseckiana\\i0{} and the more restricted southern and eastern tetraploid (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 68) as subsp. \\i{}groenlandica\\i0{}. In Fennoscandia, tetraploids occur everywhere except for the northeastern corner. Both lowland plants with many and comparatively small flowers and alpine plants with often large single flowers are tetraploid, the latter sometimes named as \\i{}C. groenlandica\\i0{}. There seems to be no discontinuity in the morphological patterns. In the northeastern (arctic) corner diploids are dominant or perhaps exclusive (see Croff 1978), with the morphological pattern of the tetraploid mountain plants. Diploids also occur in the southeastern (Swedish and Finnish) lowlands, with the morphological pattern of the tetraploid lowland plants. The few Svalbard plants that have been counted are diploid and resemble the Greenland and northeastern Fennoscandian diploids. It seems impossible, at least in the Nordic area, to recognise diploids and tetraploids, or mountain/tundra and lowland plants, as separate taxa. Hexaploids do not seem to reach the Arctic (Elven et al. 2003).\u003e","\u003cHolm (1922), in the reporting on the botanical findings of the Canadian Arctic Expedition, 1913-1918, provided a figure that showed the underground structure of this species and noted: \"Some remarkably old specimens measuring 22 cm were collected on the south coast of Coronation gulf... The vegetative structure is quite interesting. The primary root is developed as a relatively large, wrinkled tap-root, bearing several shoot at the crown. These shoots are slender, and their subterranean part bears small, scale-like leaves, while toward apex small rosettes of green leaves appear, surrounding the flowering stems. As the main, i.e., the primary, root is wrinkled, indicating that it is contractile, the crown of the root becomes gradually pulled deeper and deeper down in the ground, at the same time as the subterranean parts of the stems increase in length. In young specimens the subterranean stems are thus much shorter, sometimes barely visible, the crown of the root being close to the surface of the ground.\"\u003e","\u003cThe generic name \\i{}Achillea\\i0{} is usually interpreted as a reference to Achilles, the legendary Greek hero of the Trojan War (about 1200 B.C.). He is said to have used the foliage of yarrow to stanch the flow of blood from wounded fellow soldiers. A less romantic interpretation of the genus name is that it commemorates a Greek doctor named Achilles who recorded the medicinal uses of the plant (Warwick and Black 1982). \\par{}Burt (2000) noted that the flowers of the yarrow are white to pinkish and tend to become pinker with age. The ray and disc petals are the same colour. \\par{}There are two records from Banks Island, mapped in Porsild and Cody (1980). The specimens were not recorded in Porsild (1957), and have not been found at CAN. \\par{}Elven in Elven et al. (2003) noted that \"there are different opinions concerning this species or species group. Hultén (1968) and Hultén and Fries (1986) accepted three main northern entities: \\par{}\\i{}Achillea millefolium\\i0{} s.s. in all of Eurasia and as introduced in Greenland and (non-arctic) North America, \\par{}\\i{}Achillea lanulosa\\i0{} Nutt. as the main North American entity but mapped only north to southern Hudson Bay, and \\par{}\\i{}Achillea borealis\\i0{} Bong. in all of northern (arctic and boreal) North America. \\par{}Hultén (1968b) described and mapped them as species but indicated that subspecies might be a better rank. This was the solution of Cody (1996) for American representatives in the Yukon. Russian sources (Tzvelev, in Yurtsev 1984) accept three species but with a different interpretation. \\i{}Achillea millefolium\\i0{} s.s. is treated as a southern and northern Eurasiatic species barely penetrating the Arctic (and possibly not as a native). The northern Eurasiatic material is divided on (1) the northern European \\i{}A. apiculata\\i0{} Orlova (that is included in Hultén\u0027s concept of \\i{}A. millefolium\\i0{}) and (2) a strongly disjunct \\i{}A. nigrescens\\i0{} (E. Meyer) Rydberg occurring in northeastern Russia to Chukotka (which according to Hultén is synonymous with his purely American \\i{}A. borealis\\i0{}). These opinions have not yet been reconciled by an analysis of material.\" \\par{}Small and Catling (1999) reported that yarrow has long been used medicinally in both North America and Europe. Its reputation for healing wounds led to such common names as stanchweed, bloodwort, soldier\\rquote{}s bloodwort, nose bleed, and carpenter\\rquote{}s grass. Principal traditional uses besides stopping the flow of blood from wounds, included the treatment of fevers, the common cold, diarrhoea, dysentery, and hypertension. Yarrow has also been used in folk medicine as a cure for toothache, earache, and diseases of the lungs, bladder and kidney. Today, it is employed internally (as a tea, tincture, or pill) to treat gastrointestinal complaints (inflammation, diarrhoea, flatulence, cramps), and as a bitter aromatic (to stimulate appetite); and externally in poultices, lotions, and bath preparations. Young yarrow leaves are sometimes consumed (cooked or fresh) in salads (large amounts are said to turn urine brown). The leaves and flowers are used to flavour liqueurs, and were once substituted for hops to flavour beer. Yarrow also has insecticidal constituents (Chandler et al. 1982; Tunon et al. 1994). \\par{}Small and Catling (1999) noted that \"well over 100 chemicals have been characterised in yarrow. Of greatest interest are the lactones, present in a volatile oil. A metabolic derivative of these, azulene, was once thought to be the constituent primarily responsible for the anti-inflammatory and antipruritic properties of yarrow. However, the medicinal value could be due to chamazulene, the sesquiterpene lactones, or other constituents such as tannins, menthol, camphor, sterols, and triterpenes. The antispasmodic activity of yarrow could be due to its flavonoids. The alkaloid achillenine is an active hemostatic agent, and may explain the traditional uses of checking bleeding of wounds and sores. It has been hypothesised that the salicylic acid derivatives eugenol, menthol, or similar compounds may produce local algesia and reduction of fever. The presence of thujone, a known abortifacient, might explain some of the traditional uses of yarrow associated with the female reproductive system (however, thujone is usually present only in limited amounts).\" Small and Catling (1999, p. 9). The important constituent chamazule appears to be present in tetraploid plants only (Bélanger and Dextraze 1992). The volatile constituents in \\i{}Achillea\\i0{} vary in relation to the infraspecific variation within the species (Kokkalou et al. 1992). \\par{}\"Yarrow was once used in Ireland for love divination: young girls would cultivate a yarrow plant and subsequently place it beneath their pillow so that they would dream of their sweetheart. It was brought by bridesmaids to weddings to ensure 7 years of love. The closest that research has come to supporting such uses is the finding that the volatile oil of yarrow causes a sexual response in male cockroaches\" (Small and Catling 1999, p. 10).\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Antennaria canescens\\i0{} in a previous, restricted meaning was confined to Greenland and northeastern Canada. Male plants are unknown in Greenland and North America. Several authors (e.g., Löve 1970a, Hämet-Ahti et al. 1986) have reported this entity also from northern Fennoscandia, but in this area some recent investigators have considered \\i{}A. canescens\\i0{} to be the sexual plants with mixed sexes in the populations, whereas \\i{}A. alpina\\i0{} s.s. was the purely female agamospermic. Opinions obviously differ. Chmielewski (1998) included both plants, from northern Europe, Greenland, Canada, and Alaska, in his wide concept of subsp. \\i{}canescens\\i0{}. Europeans feel the need for a more extensive analysis before they fully accept the presence of two \u0027hairy\u0027 subspecies in Scandinavia (and Iceland), \\i{}\u0027alpina\u0027\\i0{} and \\i{}\u0027canescens\u0027\\i0{}. \\par{}In North America, the species is characterised by its dark green to dark brown involucral bracts (phyllaries) and conspicuous flags on the upper and middle cauline leaves. The basal leaves vary from glabrous to pubescent. \\par{}\\i{}Antennaria alpina\\i0{} belongs to Section \\i{}Alpinae\\i0{}, which is one of five large polyploid species complexes within the genus. The section has about 20 species names that are currently applied in an arctic context. Bayer (1993) considered that \\i{}A. alpina\\i0{} s.s. is circumboreal, fully agamospermous, and primarily hexaploid, 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 84. Bayer, in Cody (1996), treated this aggregate collectively, probably because it was difficult to analyse on North American representatives alone. Bayer (1993) applied the collective name \\i{}A. alpina\\i0{} also for some northwestern North American and amphi-Beringian entities (\\i{}\u0027compacta\u0027\\i0{}, \\i{}\u0027cryomophylla\u0027\\i0{}, and perhaps \\i{}\u0027subcanescens\u0027\\i0{}). This is not considered the best solution, and these entities - \\i{}\u0027compacta\u0027\\i0{}, \\i{}\u0027cryomophylla\u0027\\i0{}, and perhaps \\i{}\u0027subcanescens\u0027\\i0{} - are here treated as belonging to the \\i{}A. friesiana\\i0{} group. Even so, \\i{}A. alpina\\i0{} is still a very heterogeneous species. \\par{}Chmielewski (1998), using canonical discriminant analysis, determined that \\i{}A. alpina\\i0{} does occur in North America and suggested that the main morphological distinctions between the two aforementioned polyploid complexes are (a) the presence of scarious tips at the ends of middle to distal peduncular leaves in \\i{}A. alpina\\i0{} (these being absent in \\i{}A. media\\i0{}) and (b) the shape of the involucral bracts. The analyses of Chmielewski (1998) supported the recognition of \\i{}A. alpina\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}canescens\\i0{} and subsp. \\i{}porsildii\\i0{}. These taxa differed with respect to the degree, distribution, and type of pubescence of the basal leaves. \\par{}In this treatment the name \\i{}A. subcanescens\\i0{} is placed in the synonymy of \\i{}Antennaria alpina\\i0{} (L.) Gaertn. subsp. \\i{}canescens\\i0{} (Lange) Chmiel. \\i{}Antennaria subcanescens\\i0{} has been indicated by other authors as part of the \\i{}A. friesiana\\i0{} aggregate but is placed in \\i{}A. alpina\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}canescens\\i0{} by Chmielewski (1998). Male plants are unknown.\\par{}Porsild (1957) indicated that \\i{}A. subcanescens\\i0{} may be found on the Arctic Archipelago, and is endemic to northwestern North America. The range given by Porsild and Cody (1980) shows a few very scattered sites in eastern and western Greenland, southern Baffin Island, and along the Arctic Coast west to Point Hope on the Bering Strait. Plants mapped in Porsild and Cody (1980) as occurring on southeastern Baffin Island (CAN 284965, 274132) were annotated as \\i{}A. friesiana\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}freisiana\\i0{} by J.G. Chmielewski (SLRO) in 1995. Of seven specimens from continental North America, identified as \\i{}A. subcanescens\\i0{} by A.E. Porsild between 1948 and 1964, two were annotated as \\i{}A. media\\i0{} Greene J.G. Chmielewski (SLRO) in 1995 (CAN 247480, 247481) and five as \\i{}A. friesiana\\i0{} (CAN 506840, 506841, 106129, 106130, 106126). Thus no specimens currently considered to be \\i{}A. subcanescens\\i0{} have been found for the Canadian Arctic.\u003e","\u003cSection \\i{}Alpinae\\i0{}. \\par{}Male plants are unknown and the taxon is most probably an agamospecies. It occurs frequently in western Greenland, is very scattered in northeastern Canada, and has a small area in the Canadian Rockies, which is an unusual distribution pattern. This entity is in many features intermediate between the \\i{}A. alpina\\i0{} and \\i{}A. monocephala\\i0{} groups and is here proposed treated with the former. It was accepted as a separate species by Scoggan (1979). \\par{}The analyses of Chmielewski (1998) supported the recognition of \\i{}A. alpina\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}canescens \\i0{}and subsp. \\i{}porsildii\\i0{} as differing with respect to the degree, distribution, and type of pubescence of the basal leaves. In 2001, Elven examined a sheet from Nunavut, Baffin Island, Cape Searle (CAN 205051), identified as \\i{}A. alpina\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}porsildii\\i0{} by Chmielewski (1998) and considered it closer to the \\i{}A. monocephala\\i0{} agg. He annotated the specimen as \\i{}A. glabrata\\i0{}. Bayer (2006), in the treatment for \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{}, does not refer to Chmielewski\u0027s research and treats these two subspecies and \\i{}A. media\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}compacta\\i0{} in a broad concept of \\i{}A. alpina.\\par{}\\i0{}Elven et al. (2003), commenting on \\i{}Antennaria alpina\\i0{} (L.) Gaertn. subsp. \\i{}porsildii\\i0{} (E. Ekman) Chmiel., stated, \"\\i{}A. glabrata\\i0{} may be problematic to include in subsp. \\i{}porsildii\\i0{}. It is typified from western Greenland: Disco, 07-08. without year, leg. Vahl (C) lectotype, selected by Chmielewski (1998). The \u0027entity\u0027 is frequent in western Greenland, very scattered in northeast Canada and in a small area in the Canadian Rockies (omitted by Chmielewski). Male plants are unknown. It is in some features intermediate between the \\i{}A. alpina\\i0{} and \\i{}A. monocephala\\i0{} aggregates and fairly distinct from the main body of \\i{}\u0027porsildii\u0027\\i0{} s.s. in Greenland and Scandinavia. Its most evidently divergent features are as follows: one or very few and congested heads, narrow (non-spatulate) leaves, and lack of runners. The Baffin Island plants mapped....by Chmielewski (one collection in CAN) belong to this \u0027entity\u0027 and are generally more similar, in my [Elven\u0027s] opinion, to \\i{}A. monocephala\\i0{} s.l. than to \\i{}A. alpina\\i0{} s.l.\"\u003e","\u003cHultén (1968b) recognised three subspecies within \\i{}A. friesiana \\i0{}s.l.

Hultén\u0027s (1968b) circumscription of \\i{}A. friesiana\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}compacta\\i0{} included \\i{}A. densifolia\\i0{} A.E. Porsild and \\i{}A. neoalaskana\\i0{} A.E. Porsild. \\par{}Bayer and Stebbins (1993) also recognised three subspecies: \\i{}A. friesiana\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}friesiana\\i0{}, subsp. \\i{}alaskana\\i0{}, and subsp. \\i{}neoalaskana\\i0{} (A.E. Porsild) Bayer and Stebbins, indicating that the latter two subspecies are the dioecious (sexual) phase of the former gynoecious (asexual) form. Bayer (1991) considered that these sexual populations (subsp. \\i{}alaskana\\i0{} and subsp. \\i{}neoalaskana\\i0{}) are restricted to Alaska and cordilleran areas of the northern Yukon and adjacent Northwest territories, whereas the asexual phase (subsp. \\i{}friesiana\\i0{}) is \"almost circumpolar\", as this phase occurs from the central and eastern Siberian plateau eastward across the North American arctic to Greenland according to Bayer (1991). However, Elven et al. (2003) record a gap of more than 140°C of latitude between Greenland and the Lena River where the taxon is not recorded. \\par{}Bayer\u0027s (1993) work (based on field work and morphological studies of herbarium specimens) concluded that Hultén\u0027s \\i{}A. friesiana\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}compacta\\i0{} contained at least three incongruous entities that are not related to the other two subspecies of \\i{}A. friesiana\\i0{}. Chmielewski (1997) assigned \\i{}A. compacta\\i0{} as a subspecies to \\i{}A. media\\i0{}. \\par{}Chmielewski (1994), in a phenetic analysis of the morphological variation in the polyploid complex, independent of a knowledge of chromosome number and reproductive biology, concluded that the rank of subspecies was supported by the analyses for \\i{}A. friesiana\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}friesiana\\i0{} and \\i{}A. friesiana\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}alaskana\\i0{}. The subspecies were found to differ with respect to the length of the involucre, inner phyllary length, pappus length, corolla length (the latter subspecies typically smaller than the former), chromosome number, reproductive biology, and in part provenance. Chmielewski (1994) stated that \\i{}A. frieseana\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}friesiana\\i0{} is an agamospermous polyploid, represented by pentaploid (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 70) and hexaploid (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 84) cytotypes. \\i{}Antennaria friesiana\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}alaskana\\i0{} is a sexual, probably partially agamospermous, tetraploid cytotype, and either diploid (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 28) or tetraploid (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 56). \\par{}Elven et al. (2003) noted that geographically this is the major entity of Section \\i{}Alpinae\\i0{} and occurs from the Lena area throughout northeastern Asia and North America to western Greenland, i.e., through the entire range of the aggregate. Elven and Petrovsky in Elven et al. (2005) considered that the recognition of three subspecies is now well supported in their circumpolar range as well. The two sexuals (\\i{}\u0027alaskana\u0027\\i0{} and \\i{}\u0027neoalaskana\u0027\\i0{}) are consistently different, as both also are from agamospermic \\i{}\u0027friesiana\u0027\\i0{} s.s. This is now supported by all workers on this group.\u003e","\u003cSection \\i{}Alpinae\\i0{}. \\par{}\\i{}Antennaria compacta\\i0{} was included in \\i{}A. alpina\\i0{} s.l. by Bayer in Cody (1996) and in Bayer (2006), who stated that morphological overlap between \\i{}A. alpina\\i0{} and \\i{}A. media\\i0{} poses a taxonomic problem. Bayer (2006) suggests that some of the entities he has synonymised under\\i{} A. alpina\\i0{}, including \\i{}A. friesiana\\i0{} subsp.\\i{} compacta\\i0{}, are of apomictic clonal origin. This subspecies was included in \\i{}A. media\\i0{} s.l. by Chmielewski (1997). Elven et al. (2003) followed Chmielewski (1997) by recognising this taxon as a subspecies of \\i{}A. media\\i0{} because Chmielewski (1998) presented an analysis that included the\\i{} A. alpina \\i0{}complex. Elven et al. (2003) will follow this treatment until a consensus is reached about \\i{}A. alpina\\i0{} in North America and we follow this treatment here.\\par{}In \\i{}A. media \\i0{}subsp.\\i{}compacta, \\i0{}Section \\i{}Alpinae\\i0{}, male plants are unknown and the taxon is most probably an agamo-subspecies. It is a widely distributed entity from eastern Greenland to western Alaska, and perhaps to eastern Chukotka. Some authors synonymise \\i{}A. cryomophylla\\i0{} with \\i{}A. compacta\\i0{}. The very restricted continental range of \\i{}A. cryomophylla\\i0{} falls entirely inside that of \\i{}A. compacta\\i0{} (see Porsild and Cody 1980). \\par{}\\i{}Antennaria densifolia\\i0{} A.E. Porsild [Bull. Natl. Mus. Canada 101, Biol. ser. 30: 26. 1945], from the continental Northwest Territories and Yukon, has been indicated as a synonym of \\i{}A. compacta\\i0{}. This is probably not correct, as both sexes are present in populations of \\i{}A. densifolia\\i0{} and it is probably sexual (Bayer in Cody 1996). \\i{}Antennaria densifolia\\i0{} is treated as a separate species by Bayer (2006). It is not present in the Arctic, as its northern limit seems to be in the Mackenzie Mountains. \\par{}\u003e","\u003cSection \\i{}Alpinae\\i0{}. \\par{}Within the concept of \\i{}A. monocephala\\i0{} s.l., Hultén (1968b) circumscribed the apomictic form of the species as \\i{}A. monocephala\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}angustata\\i0{}, extending the range of the species to northern Yukon and Alaska and across the Canadian Arctic into Greenland and down the western Cordillera into Montana and Wyoming. Bayer (1993) chose to follow Hultén\u0027s broad concept of \\i{}A. monocephala\\i0{} and accepted \\i{}Antennaria monocephala\\i0{} (Torrey and A. Gray) DC. subsp. \\i{}philonipha\\i0{} (A.E. Porsild) Hultén [Ark. Bot., ser. 2, 7, 1: 135. 1968a], which was described from Canada: \"Arctic coast, east of Mackenzie, near Kittigazuit\". In this taxon male and female plants are equally frequent and probably sexual. It occurs almost exclusively within the range of \\i{}A. monocephala\\i0{} in Alaska, Yukon, and westernmost Nunavut, and it hybridises with \\i{}A. monocephala \\i0{}s.s. (Porsild and Cody 1980). The taxon is synonymised with \\i{}A. monocephala\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}monocephala\\i0{} by Bayer, in Cody (1996). It is suggested that there is some polymorphy in sexual \\i{}A. monocephala\\i0{} that includes \\i{}A. philonipha\\i0{}. \\par{}Chmielewski and Chinnappa (1991) considered gender dependent and independent morphological dimorphism in sexual and apomictic members in \\i{}A. monocephala\\i0{} s.l. and concluded that it is appropriate to recognise two subspecies, \\i{}A. monocephala\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}monocephala\\i0{} and \\i{}A. monocephala\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}angustata\\i0{} (Greene) Hultén. These authors indicated that these subspecies differ with respect to tomentum, chromosome number, reproductive biology, and (in part) provenance. They treated \\i{}A. monocephala\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}monocephala \\i0{}as a sexual diploid (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 28) and \\i{}A. monocephala\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}angustata\\i0{} as an apomictic polyploid, with chromosome numbers ranging from tetraploid (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 56) to octoploid (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 112). In \\i{}A. monocephala\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}monocephala\\i0{}, the adaxial surface of the basal and cauline leaves is glabrous-strigose, as is the stem. In \\i{}A. monocephala\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}angustata\\i0{}, the adaxial surface of both basal and cauline leaves is floccose-tomentose, as is the surface of the stem. \\par{}Chmielewski et al. (1990) examined the pollen morphology of North America species of \\i{}Antennaria\\i0{} (Asteraceae: Inuleae) and described the grains of \\i{}A. monocephala\\i0{} as 18.3 ± 0.8 um long in polar diameter and 18.4 ± 0.9 um long in equatorial diameter and striate-perforate-reticulate. These authors also provided an SEM illustration of a grain. \\par{}\\i{}Antennaria pygmaea\\i0{} was described from Labrador. Scoggan (1979) kept \\i{}A. pygmaea\\i0{} as a separate species based on involucral bract criteria. Bayer, in Cody (1996), synonymised \\i{}A. pygmaea\\i0{} with \\i{}A. monocephala\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}angustata\\i0{}. Male plants are unknown, and it is most probably agamospermic like the other entities synonymised with \\i{}A. monocephala\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}angustata\\i0{}.\u003e","\u003cThere is some lack of balance in current treatments between North America and Eurasia. American material is now often divided into subspecies or varieties or entities are not recognised at all. Eurasian material is either treated as one entity (in spite of heterogeneity) or divided on species. Korobkov and Elven, in Elven et al. (2003) provisionally proposed treatment as 5-6 major races (subspecies), stating that there is probably agamospermy, but at the same time each of the races are morphologically and geographically characterised. \\par{}Downie and Denford (1988b), in an evaluation of systematic relationships in \\i{}Arnica\\i0{} subgenus \\i{}Arctica\\i0{}, found that the complex consists of seven species. They proposed no new taxa and recognised several previously proposed taxa as synonyms. They found that \\i{}A. angustifolia\\i0{}, \\i{}A. frigida\\i0{}, and \\i{}A. lonchophylla\\i0{}, each consisting of two subspecies, are extremely polymorphic and variable in chromosome number. Downie and Denford (1988b) provided a taxonomic revision of the subgenus including descriptions, keys, synonymies, distribution maps, and a discussion of phylogenetic relationships. \\par{}Downie (1988) reported that the \\i{}Arnica angustifolia\\i0{} aggregate is a circumpolar taxon made up of a number of geographically distinct infraspecific taxa. Cluster and principal component analyses of 99 populations revealed the aggregate to be best represented by two subspecies: \\i{}A. angustifolia\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}angustifolia\\i0{} (a combination of the previously recognised subspecies \\i{}angustifolia\\i0{}, \\i{}attenuata\\i0{}, \\i{}sornborgeri\\i0{}, \\i{}intermedia\\i0{}, \\i{}iljinii\\i0{}, \\i{}alpina\\i0{}, and \\i{}plantaginea\\i0{}) and \\i{}A. angustifolia\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}tomentosa\\i0{}. Downie (1988) stated that \\i{}Arnica angustifolia\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}angustifolia\\i0{} is polymorphic and varied in ploidy level and foliar flavonoid chemistry. He found no significant differences among the means of 14 characters in plants collected from six broadly delimited geographic areas. He discerned four cytotypes (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 38, 57, 76, and 95) and seven flavonoid glycosides (five flavonols and two flavones). \\par{}Downie and Denford (1988a) isolated 12 flavonoids (including seven flavonol and three flavone glycosides, one flavone aglycone, and one unknown) from the leaves of 198 populations of the seven species comprising \\i{}Arnica\\i0{} subgenus \\i{}Arctica\\i0{}. They found the flavonoid profiles are relatively simple, with two to six compounds found per population, but considerable flavonoid variation was apparent in populations of \\i{}A. angustifolia\\i0{}, \\i{}A. frigida\\i0{}, and \\i{}A. lonchophylla\\i0{}. These authors suggested that in subgenus \\i{}Arctica\\i0{}, flavonoid diversity appears to have accompanied high morphological variability and suggested that leaf flavonoid chemistry supports the hypotheses that the absence of any highly derived or methylated flavonoid suggests the subgenus \\i{}Arctica\\i0{} probably represents the most ancestral subgenus in \\i{}Arnica\\i0{}. \\par{}Small and Catling (1999, p. 29) indicated that \"\\i{}Arnica\\i0{} should not be taken internally, as it is sufficiently toxic that it may cause fatal poisoning. Unidentified substances that it contains can produce stress on the nervous system, the digestive system, and the circulatory system, resulting in muscular weakness, collapse, and even death. Experiments with small animals have confirmed that arnica causes cardiac toxicity and large increases in blood pressure. This herb was listed in a 1995 Health Canada document as unacceptable as a non-prescription drug product for oral use (see \u0027Herbs used as non-medicinal ingredients in non-prescription drugs for human use,\u0027 http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hpb-dgps/therapeut/drhtmeng/policy.html)... Although not safe for human consumption, \\i{}Arnica cordifolia\\i0{} has been identified as an important constituent of the diet of elk and mule deer...

They are therefore both retained inside \\i{}A. borealis\\i0{} s.s. \\par{}Elven et al. (2003) noted that a superficial survey of the Alaskan material (ALA) by Murray and Elven showed much, and partly geographically structured, variation. It might be possible to recognise at least three entities, a main entity throughout most of the area, a north to northwestern coastal entity comparable to \\i{}\u0027richardsoniana\u0027\\i0{}, and also a southwestern coastal entity fairly distinct from the main one. All three reach the Arctic in Alaska. This variation merits further study. \\par{}Wang et al. (1990) isolated two polyacetylenes from \\i{}Artemisia borealis\\i0{}. One exhibited antifungal (\\i{}Cladosporium cucumerinum)\\i0{} activity and another was highly active in a brine shrimp (\\i{}Artemia salina\\i0{}) assay and exhibited larvicidal activity against the yellow fever mosquito (\\i{}Aedes aegypti\\i0{}).\u003e","\u003cSect. \\i{}Campestres\\i0{} Korobkov (1981), Polyni Severo-Vostoka SSSR, 112. 1981. \\par{}Ling, in Hind and Beentje (1996), considered \\i{}A. richardsoniana\\i0{} (and \\i{}A. subarctica\\i0{}) as synonyms of \\i{}A. arctica\\i0{} and not closely related to \\i{}A. borealis\\i0{}. American authors (e.g., Cody 1996) considered \\i{}A. richardsoniana\\i0{} a northwestern American endemic, but that was not supported by Elven et al. (2003). The Panarctic Flora Checklist (Elven et al. 2003) prefers to recognise the taxon as \\i{}Artemisia borealis\\i0{} Pall. subsp. \\i{}richardsoniana\\i0{} (Besser) Korobkov, in Jurtz.\u003e","\u003cThe type and other Canadian specimens have leaves covered with a \"silvery canescence\", that is, white, tomentose, and with short silky appressed hairs.

The Russian specimens usually have heads borne on conspicuous pedicels. \\par{}The eastern Canadian specimens also differ from those in Alaskan specimens of \\i{}A. furcata\\i0{}, which is considered a reason to treat the taxa separately (Elven et al. 2003).\u003e","\u003cSect. \\i{}Artemisia\\i0{}. \\par{}Porsild and Cody (1980) recognised that this taxon may be divided into subsp. \\i{}tilesii\\i0{} and subsp. \\i{}elatior\\i0{} Torrey and Gray. The latter has broader leaf-segments, is a taller plant, and does not occur as far north. \\par{}This widespread species seems to be polymorphic, particularly in North America. Hultén (1950, 1968b) recognised four subspecies, but two of these seem to be less distinctive than the others. The Panarctic Flora checklist (Elven et al. 2003) proposed recognising only two taxa and includes subsp. \\i{}gormanii\\i0{} with subsp. \\i{}elatior\\i0{} and subsp. \\i{}unalaschcensis\\i0{} in subsp. \\i{}tilesii\\i0{}. \\par{}Ovenden (1986) found \\i{}Artemisia tilesii\\i0{} was an early colonising species on the lake bed of Illisarvik, the site of a thermokarst lake that was artificially drained in August 1978. By 1985, the lake bed was dry in most areas and wind erosion was extensive. The surface material was either sandy peat or organic lake mud, except along the eastern margin, where it was sandy. Substrate type appeared to have had little influence on the distributional patterns of the colonising vegetation. More important factors were probably erosion, surface wetness, and proximity of the lake-bed margin. Other widespread species included \\i{}Tephroseris palustris\\i0{} (L.) Fourr. subsp. \\i{}congesta\\i0{} (\\i{}Senecio congestus\\i0{}), \\i{}Carex aquatilis\\i0{}, \\i{}Descurainia sophioides\\i0{}, \\i{}Tripleurospermum maritimum\\i0{} (\\i{}Matricaria ambigua\\i0{}), \\i{}Arctophila fulva\\i0{}, and \\i{}Stellaria longipes\\i0{}. \\i{}Senecio\\i0{} and \\i{}Arctophila\\i0{} formed dense stands around the two small residual ponds. \\par{}Adams et al. (1984) described the effects of simulated acid rain (pH 2.5-5.6) on the foliar histology of \\i{}A. tilesii\\i0{}, which is remarkably tolerant to naturally occurring atmospheric acidity at Smoking Hills, Northwest Territories. \\par{}Adams and Hutchinson (1984) compared the ability of leaf surfaces of \\i{}Artemisia tilesii\\i0{}, \\i{}Spinacea oleracea\\i0{}, and \\i{}Phaseolus vulgaris\\i0{} to neutralise acidic rain. Acidic droplets of identical size were placed on the leaves. The pH values over time were measured using a micro-pH electrode. The pH of rain droplets initially of pH 3.0, 3.5, and 5.6 increased after contact with leaves of these species. However, for droplets of pH 2.5 the pH of droplets actually decreased with time on leaves as the drops evaporated, despite the very large quantity of H ions neutralised by the leaf surface. Neutralisation of acidic droplets was greatest in \\i{}A. tilesii\\i0{} plants, which also showed the lowest sensitivity to foliar injury from simulated acid rain. Large increases in Ca, especially, but also in Mg and K in droplets collected from leaves of \\i{}A. tilesii\\i0{}, suggest that these cations may play an important role in increasing the pH of acidic droplets. \\par{}Hutchinson and Adams (1987) used \\i{}A. tilesii\\i0{} in a study of the relative abilities of four species to neutralise acidic rain droplets placed on their leaf surfaces. They were examined, comparing this species with leaves of sugar beet (\\i{}Beta vulgaris\\i0{}), radish (\\i{}Aphanus sativus\\i0{}), and sunflower (\\i{}Helianthus annuus\\i0{}). Rain droplets (50 mæl) of pH 4.7, 3.8, 3.0, and 2.4 were used. Determinations of droplet pH on the leaf surfaces and on a control parafilm surface were made at intervals until the leaves dried. The plants were grown in sand culture with calcium supplied at a range of five concentrations, from 4.8 to 480 ppm to alter the calcium status of the foliage. While the Ca\\super{}++\\nosupersub{} treatments strongly influenced the Ca\\super{}++ \\nosupersub{}content of leaves, they did not influence the neutralising ability of the leaves. \\par{}Overfield et al. (1980) reported that a plant used by the southwestern Alaskan Eskimos for treatment of skin infections, chest colds, and arthritis was identified as \\i{}A. tilesii\\i0{}. The volatile constituents of this plant were identified as an 80:20 mixture of thujone and isothujone. Isothujone has codeine-like properties, which may help arthritic pain.\u003e","\u003cBurt (2000) noted that this plant has a wide range from high passes in Denali National Park, Alaska, to the windswept and spray-lashed beaches of algal limestone islands off the north shore of central North America. It grows on gravel bars in the mouths of arctic rivers that are subject to annual flooding. Its \"yellow flowers spread out like a tiny bracelet at the edge of the rosette.\" (p. 192). \\par{}The habit of blooming while the flowering heads still touch the rosette is an adaptation to keep the developing ovaries within the warmest stratum of air close to the ground and the sun-warmed rocks (Savile 1972).\\par{}Elven and Murray, in Elven et al. (2005) noted that \"the two fairly closely related species previously named as \\i{}Crepis elegans\\i0{} and \\i{}C. nana\\i0{} have the base chromosome number of \\i{}x\\i0{} \u003d 7 (as opposed to 4-6 elsewhere in \\i{}Crepis\\i0{}), are characteristic morphologically, and have been separated, together with some relatives, as the genus \\i{}Askellia\\i0{} W.A.Weber, based on \\i{}Crepis\\i0{} sect. \\i{}Ixeredopsis\\i0{} Babc.\" There are good arguments for this solution (see Weber 1984), which has been followed here.\u003e","\u003cNoyes et al. (1995) stated that \\i{}E. compositus\\i0{} is an agamospermous species complex comprising sexual and agamospermous elements in which five subspecies had been informally proposed for sexual \\i{}E. compositus\\i0{}: \"\\i{}articus\\i0{},\" \"\\i{}compositus\\i0{},\" \"\\i{}pectinipetiolatus\\i0{},\" \"\\i{}penicillatus\\i0{},\" and \"\\i{}posticus.\"\\i0{} The study by Noyes et al. (1995) reported chromosome counts that showed sexual \\i{}E. compositus\\i0{} is predominantly diploid, 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 18. Sexual tetraploids, 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 36, and an aneuploid, 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 35, were also observed. Genetic variation was examined in all of the proposed subspecies, with the exception of \\i{}E. compositus\\i0{} \"\\i{}anticus\\i0{},\" and in closely related \\i{}E. vagus\\i0{}. The four proposed subspecies investigated have very similar allozymes, with a mean genetic identity value (\\i{}I\\i0{}) of 0.847. Likewise, comparisons between populations of \\i{}E. vagus\\i0{} and \\i{}E. compositus\\i0{} yield an \\i{}I\\i0{} value of 0.889. Fixation indices derived from allozyme data also showed that sexual \\i{}E. compositus\\i0{} and \\i{}E. vagus\\i0{} are strongly outcrossing. Allozyme markers, genetic similarity values, and patterns of morphological variation suggest that sexual tetraploid \\i{}E. compositus\\i0{} is derived from a cross between diploid \\i{}E. compositus\\i0{} \"\\i{}compositus\\i0{}\" and one or more of the sexual \"subspecies\" of \\i{}E. compositus\\i0{}. These results represent the first phase in the chromosomal and genetic analysis of the \\i{}E. compositus\\i0{} agamospermous complex. \\par{}Noyes and Soltis (1996, p. 1292) noted \"\\i{}Erigeron compositus\\i0{} occurs in montane western North America and comprises both sexual and agamospermous populations. Sexual \\i{}E. compositus\\i0{} had previously been characterised as outcrossing and predominantly diploid (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 18). Agamic \\i{}E. compositus\\i0{} is usually hexaploid (2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 54), though counts herein range from 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 36 to 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 80. Starch-gel electrophoresis, cytology, and analysis of pollen production were used to evaluate variation within and among agamospermous populations. Fifteen enzyme loci were used to identify 24 unique multilocus genotypes in seven populations, an average of 3.4 genotypes per population. Proportion of distinct genotypes per population sample size (\\i{}G\\i0{}/\\i{}N\\i0{}) and measures of genetic diversity (\\i{}D\\i0{}) and evenness (\\i{}E\\i0{}) were 0.10, 0.48, and 0.61, respectively, which indicate that \\i{}E. compositus\\i0{} maintains levels of diversity similar to other agamospermous taxa. Most agamospermous populations are mosaics comprising groups of genetically distinct individuals that are frequently distinguished by cytotype and capacity for pollen production. The geographical and ecological separation of sexual and agamospermous populations make it unlikely that gene flow from sexual populations is a direct source of genetic variation in agamospermous populations. Instead, crossing between genetically distinct facultative agamosperms probably accounts for most variation. Genetic and morphological evidence documented one such putative crossing event. Agamospermous \\i{}E. compositus\\i0{} is very similar genetically to sexual \\i{}E. compositus\\i0{}. Allozyme analysis further shows that genetic variation in agamospermous populations is partitioned among a few highly heterozygous genotypes, whereas sexual populations maintain numerous genotypes of relatively low heterozygosity.\"\u003e","\u003cPorsild (1957), in the key he provided, separated this species from \\i{}E. uniflorus\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}eriocephalus\\i0{} on a difference in the diameter of the flowering heads: the latter species being about 2 cm and \\i{}E. humilis\\i0{} about 1 cm in diameter. However, there are many specimens 1-2 cm in diameter. In general, the flowering heads of \\i{}E. humilis\\i0{} are smaller and narrower. In the field the difference is pronounced, and it is obvious that the capitula of \\i{}E. humilis\\i0{} have a cuneate base, while those of \\i{}E. uniflorus\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}eriocephalus\\i0{} have a broadly rounded to truncate base (Elven, personal communication, 2005).\\par{}The hairs on the involucre of \\i{}E. humilis\\i0{} are conspicuously different, appearing blackish purple from dark purple pigment at the cross-walls of the multicellular hairs. The ray florets of \\i{}E. uniflorus\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}eriocephalus\\i0{} are a pink purple, and the disc florets have the same colour on the tips of the petals. Both may have turned a whitish yellow in herbarium specimens. The ray florets of \\i{}E. humilis\\i0{} are a bluish purple, and the disc florets may have petal tips that have dried either pale yellow or brown. The two taxa are easily distinguished (see pictures in image library) and probably not very closely related phylogenetically. \\par{}Interactions between ploidy level, breeding systems, and morphologic variation have been studied in detail in \\i{}E. compositus\\i0{}. Five informally designated population systems of diploids are geographically restricted (all to the northwestern United States and closely adjacent Canada) and primarily sexual, compared to the polyploids, which are agamospermous and apparently of hybrid origin, at least in some cases (R.D. Noyes et al. 1995, Noyes and D.E. Soltis 1996). Reduction in ray floret laminae usually is correlated with polyploidy. Plants with once-ternately lobed leaves have been identified as \\i{}E. compositus\\i0{} var. \\i{}glabratus\\i0{}, an element of variation that does not have a geographic pattern. \\par{}Among its close relatives, \\i{}Erigeron compositus\\i0{} is the only species that produces strongly thickened caudex branches; occasional collections show a tendency toward the slender, loose branches characteristic of the other species (personal communication, G.

As seen from their map, this entity excluded \\i{}\u0027muirii\u0027\\i0{} but included all other northern plants of \\i{}E. grandiflorus\\i0{} in NWT, Yukon Territory, and Alaska, both the northern Cordilleran ones and the Arctic coastal plants west to Mackenzie River (but not Herschel Island). This view was also reflected by Cody (1996) who recognised \\i{}E. muirii\\i0{} as a separate species, in Canada only known from Herschel Island, whereas \\i{}E. grandiflorus\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}arcticus\\i0{} in Yukon reaches north to the Richardson Mountains. Also Cody, as late as 1996, considered both entities as purely North American. This is also confirmed by Nesom and Murray (2004); \\i{}P. porsildii\\i0{} and \\i{}P. muirii\\i0{} are both accepted as species. \\par{}Nesom and Murray (2004) were aware of this discussion and noted that it has not been clear whether \\i{}E. koraginensis \\i0{}occurs on the North America continent or whether it might be conspecific with an earlier-named American species, particularly \\i{}E. grandiflorus\\i0{}. \\i{}Erigeron koraginensis \\i0{}and \\i{}E. porsildii\\i0{} are the most similar among these species, but here, based on material housed at ALA, these authors concluded that \\i{}E. koraginensis \\i0{}and \\i{}E. porsildii\\i0{} are distinct and noted that they had seen no collections of \\i{}E. koraginensis\\i0{} from North America. \\par{}They provided the following key to distinguish these taxa. \\par{}\" 1.

The name \\i{}Hulteniella\\i0{} for the genus is used following Yurtsev (1987) in the \\i{}Flora of the Russian Arctic\\i0{}, and is used in the \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{} treatment (Brouillet 2006). \\par{}Chrysanthemums and their relatives (mainly in the genus \\i{}Pyrethum\\i0{}) are grown (mainly in Africa) to produce pyrethrins, which are used as insecticides. Pyrethrins are chemicals produced within the plant to discourage insect feeding. They can be extracted and used in sprays and other formulations to kill insects. They are considered very \"safe\" insecticides because they are not long-lived and do not accumulate in the food chain Burt (2000).\\par{}Dignard and Gervais (2003) reported on \\i{}H. integrifolia \\i0{}from the Puvirnituq and Déception rivers in Nunavik (Nouveau-Québec). They mapped the distribution of the species in the southeastern Arctic Archipelago and confirmed previous chromosome counts of 2\\i{}n\\i0{} \u003d 18.\u003e","\u003cWhen Löve and Löve (1976) erected the genus \\i{}Packera\\i0{}, they indicated that this is mainly a North and South American genus with a few representatives in Asia. It comprises the groups \\i{}Aurei\\i0{}, \\i{}Lobati\\i0{}, and \\i{}Tomentosia\\i0{} of the collective genus \\i{}Senecio\\i0{}. Taxa in \\i{}Packera\\i0{} stand apart from other divisions of the collective aggregate by having long rhizomes, and if pubescence is present it is a tomentum of more or less arachnoid and never of long jointed hairs that persist as flocculent tufts. Its morphological and geographical distinctions are enhanced by its basic chromosome number, \\i{}x\\i0{} \u003d 23, which differs from that of \\i{}Senecio\\i0{} s.s., \\i{}x\\i0{} \u003d 10, and \\i{}Tephroseris \\i0{}(Richb.) Richb., \\i{}x\\i0{} \u003d 8. \\par{}Barkley (1999), discussing the segregates of \\i{}Senecio\\i0{} that are recognised in the \\i{}Flora of North America\\i0{} treatment (Barkley 2006), including \\i{}Packera\\i0{} (Trock 2006) stated that the notions leading to these narrower generic concepts are noted in Bremer (1994) and in several papers that were presented at the Compositae Conference at Kew in the summer of 1994 (Hind and Beentje 1996). He provided a synoptic key, stating that nobody doubts the biological significance of the first couplet, but the characters used are impractical for routine plant identification. The first couplet separates the \\i{}Tussilagininae\\i0{}, which includes \\i{}Tephroseris\\i0{}, and the \\i{}Senecioninae\\i0{}, which includes \\i{}Packera \\i0{}and \\i{}Senecio\\i0{}. \\par{}1.

Two arctic-alpine species extend into northern Siberia and central Asia. The group has been known as the \\ldblquote{}aureoid complex\\rdblquote{} of \\i{}Senecio \\i0{}s.l., and although its members are superficially similar to many species of \\i{}Senecio\\i0{} it forms a distinct lineage. Intergradation among \\i{}Packera\\i0{} species is well known (Barkley 1988), but there is no morphological intergradation or putative hybridisation between any \\i{}Packera\\i0{} and any species of \\i{}Senecio\\i0{} s.s., or segregate of \\i{}Senecio\\i0{}. The pollen grains of \\i{}Packera\\i0{} have a helianthoid ultrastructure, rather than the senecionoid type (Bain and Walker 1995). An ITS-based phylogeny has been estimated for \\i{}Packera\\i0{} by Bain and Jansen (1995).\u003e","\u003cElven et al. (2003) noted that \"Löve and Löve (1975) splitted \\i{}Petasites\\i0{} s.l. [into] three genera. \\i{}Petasites\\i0{} s.s. and \\i{}Nardosmia\\i0{}, both with \\i{}x \\i0{}\u003d 10, were separated on morphological criteria from each other. \\i{}Endocellion\\i0{}, with \\i{}x\\i0{} \u003d 7, was separated on both morphological and cytological criteria from the others.

Cody recognised this entity as \\i{}Petasites frigidus\\i0{} (L.) Fr. subsp. \\i{}arcticus\\i0{} (A.E. Porsild) Cody, in Can. Field-Nat. 108: 94. 1994. Type from Mackenzie River delta, East Branch, CAN (see Porsild 1943: 74). \\par{}\\i{}Petasites frigidus\\i0{} (L.) Fr. subsp. \\i{}nivalis\\i0{} (Greene) Cody (Can. Field-Nat. 108: 94. 1994) is intermediate in some aspects between subsp. \\i{}frigidus\\i0{} and subsp. \\i{}palmatus\\i0{} but occupies a range of its own in northwestern America, west and partly north of subsp. \\i{}palmatus\\i0{}. \\par{}Cherniawsky and Bayer (1998a) considered \\i{}Petasites\\i0{} a taxonomically difficult genus in North America and presented a table comparing systematic treatments of the genus by Rydberg (1927), Cronquist (1978), Hultén (1950), Bogle (1968), Scoggan (1979), Porsild and Cody (1980), and Packer (1983). Cherniawsky and Bayer (1998b) stated that individuals are polygamodioecious, perennial, and clonal herbs that are widely distributed across Canada, Alaska, and the northern contiguous United States as far south as California. All North American taxa of \\i{}Petasites\\i0{} have sympatric ranges. These authors concluded that the morphological differentiation between \\i{}P. sagittatus\\i0{} and other taxa of \\i{}Petasites\\i0{} is not considered sufficient to warrant recognition of specific status. They recommended that only one polymorphic species of \\i{}Petasites\\i0{} in North America be recognised (\\i{}P. frigidus\\i0{} with three varieties) in addition to one hybrid taxon originating from a cross between two of the varieties. \\par{}Korobkov (in Elven et al. (2003)) proposed four species in the \\i{}P. frigidus\\i0{} aggregate: \\i{}P. frigidus\\i0{} s.s., \\i{}P. hyperboreus\\i0{} Rydberg, \\i{}P. palmatus\\i0{} (Ait.) A. Gray, and \\i{}P. arcticus\\i0{} A.E. Porsild. In North America where most of the variation occurs these intergrade and it is often impossible to keep them as species and perhaps difficult even as subspecies. Bayer et al (2006) treat them as varieties. Pending further information on the subspecific nomenclature, in the present treatment we are using the name of the species \\i{}P. frigidus\\i0{} s.l.\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Solidago multiradiata\\i0{} was found to be an early coloniser of oil spills in Alaska (Kershaw and Kershaw 1986). \\par{}Gilbert and Cooke (2001) included \\i{}S. multiradiata\\i0{} in a review study of dyes from plants: past usage, present understanding, and potential, noting that before the synthesis of dyes from byproducts of the petrochemical industry, all colour was derived from natural sources, including plants.\u003e","\u003cThis taxon is fairly distinctive and phytogeographically falls into a relictual pattern shared by several other taxa in coastal northwestern Canada and northeastern Alaska (Elven et al. 2003).\u003e","\u003cHultén\u0027s (1968b) map shows \\i{}Taraxacum ceratophorum\\i0{} (Ledeb.) DC. in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. He said this species has leaves of various forms; all or at least some involucral bracts with a horn or tubercle below the apex; outer bracts mostly appressed and broader than the inner ones. Hultén (1968b) commented that \\i{}T. ceratophorum\\i0{} is composed of a large group of small taxa, which maintain themselves as distinct units through seeds that are formed without fertilisation. \\par{}The name \\i{}T. lacerum\\i0{} used in Porsild (1957) for some Baffin Island dandelions is considered inapplicable, as none of the specimens from the Canadian Arctic Archipelago resemble that species when compared with an isotype of that species that is from northern British Columbia. CAN! (see image library). After examining specimens that Porsild labelled \\i{}T. lapponicum\\i0{}, Aiken and Brouillet (July 2003) found no reason for not merging them into their concept of \\i{}T. ceratophorum.\\i0{}\u003e","\u003cThis High Arctic dwarf species has plants with leaves that are usually patent, and deeply runcinate with staggered lobes on either side of the midvein. The degree of incision of the sinuses reaches almost to the midvein, and there are often additional dentations on the runcinate lobes. Petioles are almost without a wing at the base. The inner phyllaries (involucral bracts) are constricted, calloused, and often horned; the outer petals have a distinct stripe that is more obvious in pressed material. The cypselas are straw-coloured with beaks that have a distinct cone. The cypselas are spinulose throughout, but more strongly so towards the apex.\u003e","\u003cThe sub-entire or shallowly dentate leaves are similar to those of \\i{}T. phymatocarpum\\i0{}. \\i{}Taraxacum hyparcticum\\i0{} differs from \\i{}T. phymatocarpum \\i0{}in having wide scarious margins on the inner involucral bracts, much larger and relatively large, pale creamy yellow heads with ligulate petals that often have a tinge of pink. The heads spread fully open and flat at anthesis; those of \\i{}T. phymatocarpum \\i0{}spread less. The cypselas of \\i{}T. hyparcticum\\i0{} have beaks that are often tinged rusty orange; the cypsela surfaces are straw-coloured with a reddish tinge or olivacous. They are often only spinulose towards the apex and similar to the illustration in Dahlstedt (1905, p. 21). The cypselas of \\i{}T. phymatocarpum \\i0{}are grey or black with conspicuous longitudinal grooves and well-developed spicules over most of the surface.\\par{}Porsild (1957) reported pollen lacking.

It is closely related to \\i{}T. atropurpurea\\i0{} (Ledeb.) Holub and \\i{}T. subfrigida\\i0{} (Kom.) Holub, and recognition of these three as three subspecies of one species is defensible. The species name \\i{}\u0027atropurpurea\u0027\\i0{} (1815) has priority before the name \\i{}\u0027frigida\u0027\\i0{} (1823).\\par{}Burt (2000) stated that this species has a scattered growth habit, and seems to prefer heath tundra that is neither too wet nor too dry, such as protected areas where snow likely collects fairly early in the winter.\u003e","\u003cThis is the largest annual plant species in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. \"In the early stages of growth, the leaves, stem, and flowering heads are all covered with translucent hairs -- producing a \"greenhouse effect\" close to the surface of the plant, essentially extending the growing season by a few vital days by allowing the sun to warm the tissues, and preventing the heat from escaping\" (Burt 2000, p. 196; see image library). \\par{}Porsild and Cody (1980) claim that \\i{}Tephroseris palustris\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}congesta\\i0{} (\\i{}Senecio congestus\\i0{}) is \"hapaxanthic\" or flowering only once and then dying afterwards. In high latitudes, specimens in which the flowers of the year are killed by early frost may flower and fruit the following year. \\par{}Ovenden (1986) found \\i{}Tephroseris palustris\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}congesta\\i0{} to be an early colonising species on the lake bed of Illisarvik, the site of a thermokarst lake that was artificially drained in August 1978. \\par{}Gloschenko and Martini (1987) studied the vegetation of four river-influenced coastal marshes located between the Moose River and Harricanaw River in southern James Bay. Six major groupings of species were found. These included (1) a salt marsh dominated by \\i{}Puccinellia phryganodes\\i0{}, \\i{}P. lucida\\i0{}, \\i{}Hippuris\\i0{} \\i{}tetraphylla\\i0{}, and \\i{}Scirpus maritimus\\i0{}, (2) saline ponds with \\i{}Tephroseris palustris\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}congesta\\i0{}, (3) a saline/brackish meadow marsh with \\i{}Carex paleacea\\i0{}, (4) an intertidal estuarine marsh with \\i{}Eleocharis palustris\\i0{}, (5) freshwater ponds with \\i{}Potamogeton filiformis\\i0{}, and (6) a freshwater marsh/fen. Major environmental factors controlling the distribution of these groups include substrate salinity, river flow patterns, storm surges, and tidal range. The marshes described were considered unique in species composition in James Bay and similar to marshes described in the Gulf of Boothia. \\par{}Staniforth et al. (1998) noted that coastal ecosystems at high latitudes are exposed to physical disturbances (abrasion by ice, tides, waves, and wind) and to degradation due to the grazing activities of waterfowl. The frequency of disturbance and the regenerative capacity of plants determine the recovery potential for the plant community. They examined the seed bank in soil samples collected from a beach ridge, a drift zone, a sand bar, and a salt marsh at Bird Cove, near Churchill, Manitoba, on the western shoreline of Hudson Bay. Seedling emergence from soil samples after four successive periods of stratification at 5°C totalled 2968 seedlings of 19 species. Mean emerged seedling densities for each ecosystem were (i) 786 seedlings/m2 (beach ridge), (ii) 699 seedlings/m2 (drift zone), (iii) 2875 seedlings/m2 (sand bar), and (iv) 39,204 seedlings/m2 (salt marsh). These densities are much higher than those for temperate coastal ecosystems and for most terrestrial, subarctic ecosystems. Ninety-seven percent of the 2772 identifiable emergents were of three ruderal species: \\i{}Juncus bufonius\\i0{}, \\i{}Tephroseris palustris\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}congesta\\i0{} (\\i{}S. congestus\\i0{}), and \\i{}Spergularia marina\\i0{}. These three common species were found from samples collected from all ecosystems except the beach ridge, which had no species in common with the other ecosystems and was dominated by \\i{}Sagina nodosa\\i0{} and \\i{}Saxifraga tricuspidata\\i0{} in its seed bank.\u003e","\u003cWhen Hämet-Ahti (1967) proposed this name combination, she noted that it was first described at variety level (not as a form as often cited) by Ruprecht (1845) from arctic Russia. Trautvetter (1871, p. 74; not Ruprecht as reported by Porsild 1932, p. 72) considered it a synonym of \\i{}Pyrethrum ambigum\\i0{} described by Ledebour (1833, p. 118) from the Altai Mountains. Thereafter many later authors have applied the epithet \\i{}ambigum\\i0{} to this taxon. Hämet-Ahti (1967) had seen the types of both Ruprecht and Trautvetter and noted that although Ruprecht\u0027s type specimen is very poor, a comparison of other material from northernmost Russia and the Altai material showed so many differences that she could not regard them as identical. The main differences noted are the narrower bracts that are only slightly triangular, and the shorter leaf segments that are narrower in the Altai specimens than in those from northern Russia. Ecologically, \\i{}T. maritimum\\i0{} supsp. \\i{}phaeocephalum\\i0{} is both a seashore and an ruderal plant. \\par{}This species was in the genus \\i{}Matricaria. \\i0{}\"According to Schofield (1989) the name \"\\i{}Matricaria\\i0{}\" is derived from the Latin roots \\i{}matrix\\i0{} \"mother\" and \\i{}caria\\i0{} \"dear\". This refers to the long historical use of this genus as medicine for female problems and as a medicine for children. Flower heads of the pineapple weed (\\i{}Matricaria matricariodes\\i0{}) are widely used as a relaxing tea and medicine by the Dene, Aleuts, and herbalists everywhere. It is said to be an effective insect repellent and to remove fish odours from your hands\" (Burt 2000, p. 188). \\par{}Ovenden (1986) found \\i{}Tripleurospermum maritimum \\i0{}(as \\i{}Matricaria ambigua\\i0{}) to be an early colonising species on the lake bed of Illisarvik, the site of a thermokarst lake that was artificially drained in August 1978. \\par{}The entities treated as subspecies in Elven et al. (2003) are sometimes treated as species by Russian botanists. Fertile intermediates are frequent in the Nordic area where the three entities meet Hämet-Ahti (1967). Thus, treatment as subspecies is preferable. However, the circumpolar arctic entity \u0027\\i{}phaeocephalum\\i0{}\u0027 is slightly more different from the other two subspecies than they are among themselves and also geographically better separated. This may justify treatment of \\i{}T. phaeocephalum\\i0{} as a species (as fairly regularly done both in Russia and North America).\u003e"]},{"type":"UM","states":["recorded","not recorded","recording in progress"],"id":514,"name":"morphological data \u003cwhether recorded\u003e","data":[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]},{"type":"UM","states":["accepted in this study","not accepted in this study \u003cor, a synonym\u003e","not yet recorded on arctic islands, but probably in the PAF arctic area","grass species added as occurring in arctic continental North America","taxonomic status under consideration"],"id":515,"name":"\u003cwhether accepted in this study\u003e","data":[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]},{"type":"UM","states":["species","genus","family","higher level classification \u003ce.g. order or class\u003e"],"id":516,"name":"\u003ctaxonomic level\u003e","data":[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]}],"taxa":[{"id":3,"name":"\\i{}Equisetum arvense\\i0{} \u003cL.\u003e","images":[{"f":"eqeqase3.jpg","n":""},{"f":"b4261086.jpg","n":""},{"f":"eqeqasc2.jpg","n":""},{"f":"eqeqave1.jpg","n":""},{"f":"eqeqarc5.jpg","n":""},{"f":"eqeqvac1.jpg","n":""},{"f":"eqeqvai1.jpg","n":""},{"f":"eqeqarb1.jpg","n":""},{"f":"eqeqarc1.jpg","n":""},{"f":"eqeqarc7.jpg","n":""},{"f":"eqeqarc9.jpg","n":""},{"f":"eqeqarc4.jpg","n":""},{"f":"eqeqavm.gif","n":""}]},{"id":4,"name":"\\i{}Equisetum scirpoides\\i0{} \u003cMichx.\u003e","images":[{"f":"eqeqscc5.jpg","n":""},{"f":"eqeqscc3.jpg","n":""},{"f":"eqeqscc4.jpg","n":""},{"f":"eqeqsci5.jpg","n":""},{"f":"eqeqscr2.jpg","n":""},{"f":"eqeqscr3.jpg","n":""},{"f":"eqeqvab1.jpg","n":""},{"f":"eqeqscm.gif","n":""}]},{"id":5,"name":"\\i{}Equisetum variegatum\\i0{} \u003cSchleich. ex F.
