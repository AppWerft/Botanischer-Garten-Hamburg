The seedlings that did mature produced little seed (Forsling and Dayton, 1931). \\par{}Three endophytic fungal symbionts of \\i{}Endochloe typhina\\i0{} have been reported for \\i{}F. arizonica\\i0{} (An et al. 1992).\u003e","\u003cWhen Polunin (1940) described \\i{}F. baffinensis\\i0{} as a new species he indicated that his collection \\i{}706\\i0{} was the type and that he had two cotypes. He published that he had deposited the type in the Gray Herbarium (GH) and the cotypes at the National Herbarium of Canada (CAN) and the British Museum (BM). A collection, \\i{}Polunin 706\\i0{}, at the BM (photograph by L. L. Consaul, October 1994, in the image library) was chosen as a lectotype by Pavlick (1984). It is a mixed collection with plants of both \\i{}F. baffinensis\\i0{} and \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} Schult. \u0026 Schult. f. indicated by Pavlick\u0027s annotation on the sheet. Collections of \\i{}Polunin 705\\i0{} from the same locality on the same date have been located at the Gray and CAN (photograph of the GH specimen, in the image library). As the collection \\i{}706\\i0{} is the more complete and aesthetically pleasing specimen, we suggest that it was chosen as the holotype and that a mistake occurred in depositing the cotypes. No specimen of \\i{}Polunin 706\\i0{} at CAN, has been found. \\par{}McNeill and Dore (1976) suggested that \\i{}F. baffinensis\\i0{} may be a subspecies of \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{}. In the musters formed by the Lefkovitch (1993) analyses, \\i{}F. baffinensis\\i0{} grouped with \\i{}F. minutiflora\\i0{} Rydb.; \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} was in a separate group. In isozyme and morphological studies of four Arctic species (Aiken et al. 1993, 1995) reported consistent differences in \\i{}F. baffinensis\\i0{}. A study of phenotypic plasticity in the same species (Ramesar-Fortner et al. 1995) documented differences in the growth response of \\i{}F. baffinensis\\i0{} and \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} under controlled growth conditions. These findings are further substantiated in Aiken et al. (1997). \\par{}This species occurs in the United States, as documented by Frederiksen (1979). She noted it had been reported from Colorado by Weber (1961) but that it was rare with a scattered distribution through most of the Rocky Mountains and seems identical with \\i{}F. baffinensis\\i0{} from the Arctic. In the course of mapping the North American distribution of the species, many records of collections in the United States have been found.\u003e","\u003cThis species is phenotypically plastic and responds dramatically to additional nutrients in an environment. Plants grew to 55 cm tall when they were moved from exposed sites in the Rocky Mountains of Alberta to Ellerslie Experimental Station, near Edmonton, Alberta. There they were grown in rich black soil in a transplant experiment (voucher specimens at DAO). \\i{}Festuca brachyphylla\\i0{} occupies the widest range of habitats of any of the North American arctic taxa. \\par{}Whether distinctions between \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} and \\i{}F. saximontana\\i0{} Rydb. deserve species status has been debated. Gleason and Cronquist (1991) treated \\i{}F. saximontana\\i0{} as a variety named \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} var. \\i{}rydbergii\\i0{} (St.-Yves) Cronquist. The taxonomic status of specimens of \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} from the Canadian Arctic has been considered by Aiken et al. (1992, 1993, 1994, 1995), who found the results of SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecylsulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) analyses of seed proteins and isozyme studies provided additional evidence to justify treating these taxa as species. The type specimen was collected on Melville Island, in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, 74°46\u0027N, 110°46\u0027W, and specimens from this island are hexaploid (Mosquin and Hayley 1966). These authors also reported a tetraploid collection from the same location. The voucher specimen for the tetraploid, at DAO, was examined by S.G. Aiken (1994) and annotated as \\i{}F. hyperborea\\i0{} Holmen ex Frederiksen.\u003e","\u003cFrederiksen (1982) distinguished this subspecies partly because of the recorded chromosome number 2\\i{}n\\i0{}\u003d28 which differs from that of \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}brachyphylla\\i0{} 2\\i{}n\\i0{}\u003d42. She also distinguished \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}breviculmis\\i0{} as a Californian endemic with a high altitude distribution range in the Californian mountains peaks. Plants collected in Colorado at Summit Lake, altitude 3917 m, 10 July 1988, \\i{}S. J. Darbyshire 3850\\i0{}, (CAN 535149, illustrated in the image library) and a collection from Colorado: La Plata County, San Juan National Forest, 37°38\u0027N, 107°37\u0027W, on rock ledges below the summit of Eoleus, elevation 13,900 feet, 29 July 1962, \\i{}Joan Michener 887\\i0{}, (COLO 181103), match collections from the White Mountains of California, although most collections from the Rocky Mountains are larger and appear to occur in a wider range of habitats. \\i{}Festuca brachyphylla\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}coloradensis\\i0{} appears to be almost as phenotypically plastic as subsp. \\i{}brachyphylla\\i0{}. \\par{}Frederiksen (1982) photographed relatively large plants of this taxon that she called subsp. \\i{}coloradensis\\i0{} and relatively small plants that she called subsp. \\i{}breviculmis\\i0{}. Limited examination of high alpine collections from Arizona, California, Colorado and New Mexico indicates that the taxon occurs at altitudes above 2800 m. In August 1988, plants of this taxon were observed growing beside \\i{}F. saximontana\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}purpusiana\\i0{} (St.-Yves) Tzvelev in the White Mountains of California and in that location the plants of the later taxon were conspicuously \"more robust\", had flowered and were beginning to set seed, while plants of \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}coloradensis\\i0{} were just coming into flower (illustrated in the image library).\u003e","\u003cFrederiksen (1978) documented that \\i{}F. ovina\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}alaskana\\i0{} Holmen is conspecific with \\i{}F. brevissima\\i0{}, which occurs on both sides of the Bering Strait. Material named as \\i{}F. ovina\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}alaskana\\i0{} by North American authors is generally referable to \\i{}F. lenensis\\i0{}. The anthers of \\i{}F. ovina\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}alaskana\\i0{} were originally described as being 2.5-3 mm long, as in \\i{}F. lenensis\\i0{}, but the type specimen was determined by Frederiksen (1978) to have much shorter anthers and was transferred to \\i{}F. brevissima\\i0{}. \\par{}Unlike \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} Schult. \u0026 Schult. f., \\i{}F. edlundiae\\i0{} S. Aiken, Consaul, \u0026 Lefkovitch, and \\i{}F. hyperborea\\i0{} Holmen ex Frederiksen, the panicle branches of \\i{}F. brevissima\\i0{} spread at anthesis. Frederiksen (1978) indicated that this species differs from \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} in being smaller, having shorter flag leaf blades, fewer spikelets, (usually one per branch), and glaucous colour. It differs from \\i{}F. hyperborea\\i0{} in having erect leaves that may have 7-9 veins, usually longer flag leaves, somewhat longer anthers, and the lanceolate lemmas with erect terminal awns. Other features distinguishing \\i{}F. brevissima\\i0{} include the thin, wiry rachis that is often slightly curved, the somewhat longer ligule, and the usually attenuate glumes. Length of the flag leaf blade in \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} was observed to be extremely variable during field work in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. The character, shorter flag leaf blades, should be used with caution. Plants of \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} occurring in the same areas of North America as \\i{}F. brevissima\\i0{} usually have well developed flag leaf blades.\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Festuca calligera\\i0{} has been compared with \\i{}F. arizonica\\i0{} and \\i{}F. idahoensis\\i0{} and assessed as a possible hybrid between them, following the suggestion of Cronquist et al. (1977) that the latter two taxa may intergrade. The leaf anatomy in cross sections and the distribution maps of the taxa, mapped in this database, lend support to this idea. Plants of \\i{}F. arizonica\\i0{} have ovaries with a densely hairy apex, \\i{}F. idahoensis\\i0{} plants have ovaries with a glabrous apex, and \\i{}F. calligera\\i0{} specimens have ovaries with a few sparse hairs at the apex, similar to the ovary apex for \\i{}F. minutiflora\\i0{} Rydb. (Frederiksen 1979, illustrated in the image library under \\i{}F. minutiflora\\i0{}). Hairs are absent in the early stages of development, when the ovaries are less than 1 mm high and without the styles completely separated at the base. Many samples have been collected at early stages of development. Pollen fertility has been examined in two anthers of approximately 10 specimens of \\i{}F. calligera\\i0{} and anthers with 90-100% stainable pollen were found. Approximately 10 grams of well formed seeds were collected by C.-E. Granfelt at two sites in Northern Arizona. The seeds of \\i{}F. calligera\\i0{} are conspicuously smaller than the seeds of \\i{}F. arizonica\\i0{} received from the same general locality. \\par{}In 1993 and 1994, Carl-Eric Granfelt made collections of both \\i{}F. arizonica\\i0{} and \\i{}F. calligera\\i0{} from above 2800 m on the White Mountains and Escudilla Mountain of north eastern Arizona. Specimens (deposited at CAN) are sometimes similar in height but the bases of the plants are strikingly different as \\i{}F. arizonica\\i0{} has conspicuous, persisting sheaths and usually leaves more than twice as long as adjacent plants of \\i{}F. calligera\\i0{}. In the latter species the sheaths are not conspicuous and the culms below the inflorescences are glabrous. \\par{}\\i{}Festuca arizonica\\i0{} and \\i{}F. calligera\\i0{} grow in the same grassland association, sometimes within a metre of each other (illustrated in the image library). They do not appear to hybridize, possibly because \\i{}F. arizonica\\i0{} flowers later than \\i{}F. calligera\\i0{} (C-E. Granfelt, Pinetop Arizona, personal observations, 1993-1996). Awn length in specimens of \\i{}F. arizonica\\i0{} varies from 0.4-2(-2.7) mm long, and in \\i{}F. calligera\\i0{} from 1-2.5 mm. No basis for separating the \"long-awned forms\" of \\i{}F. arizonica\\i0{}, referred to by Cronquist et al. (1977), has been found. \\par{}\\i{}Festuca calligera\\i0{} appears to occur in the south-western United States at altitudes above 2800 m. Many of the herbarium specimens have been collected at early stages of flowering and in such collections, floral characters are more difficult to interpret. Aldon and Barstad (1987) listed \\i{}F. ovina\\i0{} as occurring in the Escudilla study site and voucher specimens for the name used were checked and are considered to be plants of \\i{}F. calligera\\i0{}. This species appears to have been under collected and generally overlooked. (Also see notes for \\i{}F. arizonica\\i0{}).\u003e","\u003cThis species was placed in a monotypic genus by Weber (1984) as \\i{}Argillochloa dasyclada\\i0{}, but this has been refuted by Aiken et al. (1992) and Darbyshire and Warwick (1992). No reason for separating this species from \\i{}Festuca\\i0{} is apparent in the analyses by Lefkovitch (1993). In phenotypic and cladistic analyses, using this database, the position of \\i{}F. dasyclada\\i0{} varied considerably in different analyses. Seed protein evidence, anatomy, and a general lack of characters beyond the inflorescence structure discourage recognizing this taxon as a distinct genus. \\par{}The following are details from notes on the isotype specimen at GH (illustrated in the image library). The label at the bottom left hand corner reads, \"Flora of central Utah. No. 93. Coll. C.C. Parry. 1895\". The letter on the upper right hand side reads as follows, with (?) indicating hand written words that could not be interpreted. \"Dupl. Muhlenbergia? Dr. Thurber. Culms erect from a perennial (?) root, about 1-foot high, scabrous below the panicle and pubescent below the nodes, otherwise smooth; leaves (?) long about a line wide, strongly pubescent on the upper surface, nearly smooth below, rough on the margins, the uppermost reduced to a mere sheath; ligule a hairy fringe; sheaths loose, smooth, or minutely pubescent between the striae; panicle about 4 inches long, open, few flowered; rays in pairs, subdivided in a similar manner above the middle, much flattened and 2-edged or, with the apis 3-angled, strongly ciliolate fringed on the angles, pale yellowish green throughout; spikelets exclusive of awn, 2 lines long with pedicels mostly much longer; glumes herbaceous, hyaline on the margins, lanceolate, acute or somewhat acuminate, ciliate on the keel towards the apex, the upper one third the longer and barely equalling the floret, its lateral nerves evanescent towards the apex; floret lanceolate with a distinct rounded smooth callus accompanied by a conspicuous rudiment of a second flower; lower palet of firmer texture\". C.A. Taylor Jr. has written, \"Isotype: part of sole known collection. August 27, 1947\". Under the hand written label, \"Festuca dasyclada Hack.\" is printed, \"Named by F. Lamson-Scribner\".\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Festuca earlei\\i0{} has a densely hairy ovary, a character that is present in other ovina-like species, e.g. \\i{}F. occidentalis\\i0{} Hook., and one that distinguishes \\i{}F. earlei\\i0{} from \\i{}F. rubra\\i0{} L., as do the anther lengths (less than 1 mm long in \\i{}F. earlei\\i0{}. and more than 2 mm in \\i{}F. rubra\\i0{}). When Rydberg (1905) described \\i{}F. earlei\\i0{} as a new species, he claimed it was related to \\i{}F. rubra\\i0{}. \\par{}Some specimens of \\i{}F. earlei\\i0{} were described by St.-Yves (1925) as \\i{}F. brevifolia\\i0{} var. \\i{}endotera\\i0{} St.-Yves and \\i{}F. brevifolia\\i0{} var. \\i{}utahensis\\i0{} St.-Yves. The collection, \\i{}Baker 175\\i0{}, was cited as an example of the latter taxon. Two sheets of the \\i{}Baker 175\\i0{} collection, borrowed from RM, have slightly smaller plants than many specimens of \\i{}F. earlei\\i0{} (when compared with size ranges in this database). St.-Yves (1925) cited both \\i{}Baker 175 and 176\\i0{} as examples of \\i{}F. brevifolia\\i0{} var. \\i{}endotera\\i0{}. Frederiksen (1979) placed both subspecies in synonymy with \\i{}F. minutiflora\\i0{} Rydb., but commented that she included \\i{}F. brevifolia\\i0{} var. \\i{}utahensis\\i0{} only with some hesitation, pointing out that it deviates from \\i{}F. minutiflora\\i0{} especially in having more florets per spikelet and broader leaves. She claimed to have found transitional specimens even among the few specimens examined. Some specimens annotated by Frederiksen as \\i{}F. minutiflora\\i0{} are plants of \\i{}F. earlei\\i0{}. Cronquist et al. (1977) placed \\i{}F. brevifolia\\i0{} var. \\i{}endotera\\i0{} in synonymy with \\i{}F. ovina\\i0{}, indicating that there were numerous collections cited from the western U.S. and Canada. \\par{}Alexeev (1982), as translated from Russian, stated that \"this is the only North American species with small anthers (0.6-0.75 mm long), extravaginal shoot regeneration, short underground rhizomes, and sheaths that are closed almost to the top. We know of only two Central Asiatic species with this combination of characters - \\i{}F. venusta\\i0{} St.-Yves and \\i{}F. nitidula\\i0{} Stapf. St.-Yves (1925) assigned the type specimen of \\i{}F. earlei\\i0{} to a variety that he described, i.e., \\i{}F. brevifolia\\i0{} var. \\i{}endotera\\i0{}, which represents a conglomerate of four small-anthered species: \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} Schult. \u0026 Schult. f., \\i{}F. minutifolia\\i0{} Rydb., \\i{}F. saximontana\\i0{} Rydb., and \\i{}F. earlei\\i0{}. Only two of these - \\i{}F. earlei\\i0{} and \\i{}F. minutiflora\\i0{} - have a pilose ovary, and only one - \\i{}F. earlei\\i0{} - has extravaginal shoots.\" \\par{}In the course of the study, the first author has examined approximately 30 specimens of \\i{}F. earlei\\i0{} without finding evidence of the horizontal \"short underground rhizomes\" referred to by Alexeev (1982). Some samples have evidence of an etiolated basal \"tussock\" and short vertical stems from which roots arise. Both \\i{}F. earlei\\i0{} and \\i{}F. minutiflora\\i0{} show phenotypic plasticity with evidence on herbarium labels suggesting that small and large plants have often come from different microhabitats, even at the same location (for example \\i{}Baker 175 and 176\\i0{}). Large specimens of \\i{}F. earlei\\i0{} are sufficiently robust to have been identified as \\i{}F. rubra\\i0{}, while many specimens of \\i{}F. minutiflora\\i0{} have previously been identified as \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{}. Large specimens of \\i{}F. minutiflora\\i0{} approach the dimensions of small to medium size specimens of \\i{}F. earlei\\i0{}, but have a finer more delicate form when the two species are compared. \\par{}The nearest neighbour of \\i{}F. earlei\\i0{} in distance matrices, generated by the DELTA program DIST from this database, is \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}brachyphylla\\i0{}. Twelve other taxa classified as \\i{}F. ovina\\i0{}-like are nearer than the closest taxon of the \\i{}F. rubra\\i0{} complex. The leaf anatomy in cross section was considered more ovina-like (Aiken and Consaul 1995).\u003e","\u003cThe taxon was first identified as a new species by B. May, University of California at Davis, (personal communicaton 1992), from isozyme analyses (Aiken et al. 1994). The specific epithet honours Dr. Sylvia A. Edlund, for her extensive and intensive contributions to Arctic field work and her studies of vegetation in the Arctic Archipelago over many years. Previously, specimens of \\i{}F. edlundiae\\i0{} were usually placed in \\i{}F. hyperborea\\i0{} or \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} Schult. \u0026 Schult. f. A study of phenotypic plasticity in four species of arctic fescues (Ramesar-Fortner et al. 1995) reported differences in the growth response of \\i{}F. edlundiae\\i0{} and \\i{}F. hyperborea\\i0{} under controlled growing conditions.\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Festuca filiformis\\i0{} is a European introduction in North America, which is sometimes sold under the name \"ovina\" or \"sheep fescue\". The occurrence of the species in Eastern Canada was discussed in Aiken and Darbyshire (1990). It was observed to be planted extensively beside roads in Nova Scotia (Aiken and Consaul, observations 1992). Occasional herbarium specimens indicate that \\i{}F. filiformis\\i0{} has been introduced to Western North America, but the extent is not known. \\i{}Festuca filiformis\\i0{} and \\i{}F. trachyphylla\\i0{} (Hack.) Krajina are available in \"blue\" glaucous forms sold under the trade name \"glauca\". \\i{}Festuca\\i0{} plants labelled \"glauca\" in ornamental gardens may be either species, but in western North America they are more usually \\i{}F. trachyphylla\\i0{}.\u003e","\u003cFor taxonomic discussion see Aiken and Darbyshire (1990).\u003e","\u003cAlthough this taxon was recognized as distinct by Holmen (1952) for specimens collected in Greenland, Porsild (1964) did not recognize it as occurring on the Arctic Islands. Frederiksen (1977) formally published a species description that also included characteristics of the species now recognized as \\i{}F. edlundiae\\i0{} S. Aiken, Consaul, \u0026 Lefkovitch (Aiken et al. 1995).\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Festuca idahoensis\\i0{} was considered a distinct species by Rydberg (1917), Hitchcock and Chase (1951), Hitchcock et al. (1969), and Cronquist et al. (1977). Boivin (1967) considered the taxon to be \\i{}F. occidentalis\\i0{} var. \\i{}ingrata\\i0{} (Hack. ex Beal) Boivin, but this was not generally accepted and reasons for not doing so were presented by Pavlick (1983a). \\par{}That \\i{}F. idahoensis\\i0{} was initially recognized as three varieties of \\i{}F. ovina\\i0{}, (var. \\i{}ingrata\\i0{}, var. \\i{}oregona\\i0{}, and var. \\i{}columbiana\\i0{}) is a reflection on the phenotypic plasticity observed in this species. The ranges of size variation recorded for characters in the species, as currently circumscribed, are larger than for any other taxon in the data bank. For example, among collections from Colorado there are plants from high altitudes (2500-3000 m), that often have scabrous leaves, with leaf sections smaller on average and with fewer than the 5 veins usually present in cross sections of leaves of \\i{}F. idahoensis\\i0{} plants. Fully mature spikelets may be under 6 mm long and have only two florets, which contrasts sharply with large spikelets of \\i{}F. idahoensis\\i0{} that may reach 19 mm in length and have as many as 9 florets. \\par{}Whether distinct subspecies or varieties within \\i{}F. idahoensis\\i0{} s.l., beyond subsp. \\i{}roemeri\\i0{} (Pavlick) S. Aiken should be recognized, has not been determined. Since the data for \\i{}F. idahoensis\\i0{} includes wide ranges for character sizes, it is not surprising that the INTKEY program \u0027Diagnose\u0027 draws attention to problems found in separating small plants of this taxon, from \\i{}F. saximontana\\i0{} Rydb. The taxa can be readily distinguished by the length of the awns (\\i{}F. idahoensis\\i0{} 2-7 mm; \\i{}F. saximontana\\i0{} up to 2.5 mm) and by the length of the anthers (\\i{}F. idahoensis\\i0{} 2.5-4 mm; \\i{}F. saximontana\\i0{} 1.2-2.1 mm) when these characters are present. Pre-anthesis specimens of \\i{}F. idahoensis\\i0{}, from high altitudes, provide many identification challenges. \\par{}Pavlick (1983b) stated that in British Columbia, subsp. \\i{}idahoensis\\i0{} occurs in grasslands and in open areas in the montane and subalpine zones. In the grasslands, it occupies relatively mesic situations; in the dry zone of southern British Columbia, it occupies the more mesic mid valley slopes. In the montane and subalpine zones, it occurs on the open, south-facing slopes, in open forests, and in grass balds. It has previously been recorded as an important component of the grasslands and dry forest vegetation of southern British Columbia east of the Cascade Mountains by Spilsbury and Tisdale (1944), Tisdale (1947), McLean and Holland (1958), Brayshaw (1965, 1970) and McLean (1970). \\par{}Idaho fescue excels many of its associated forage species in ability to withstand heavy grazing and trampling, although it will succumb to continued grazing abuse. All classes of livestock relish it in the spring, as well as later in the season, where it grows on north slopes or in cooler, moister sites and where the herbage remains tender. Under such conditions it is often grazed more closely than other associated grasses. As the season advances the plants tend to become somewhat tough and harsh, and less succulent, with a proportionate decrease in palatability for sheep. This species cures well on the ground and makes a good or very good fall forage. When accessible, it is also a good forage for winter use (Dayton 1931).\u003e","\u003cFirst described as a variety, but treated here as a subspecies based on analyses of this database, and unpublished evidence from the seed protein banding profile. It appears to be a geographically distinct taxon. (B.L. Wilson, University of Oregon, personal communication 1996). \\par{}Pavlick (1983b) stated that \"the habitat of var. \\i{}roemeri\\i0{} on Vancouver Island is influenced by being in the rain shadow of the Olympic and Vancouver Island mountains and in having mild winters in which most precipitation is rain. ...On Vancouver Island var. \\i{}roemeri\\i0{} occurs on south-facing, grass balds up to about 500 m elevation and at lower elevations in open, often rocky outcrop areas in the \\i{}Pseudotsuga menziesii\\i0{} or \\i{}Quercus garryana\\i0{} forests.\" \\par{}Pavlick (1983b) gave the following attributes for distinguishing the taxa: \\par{}Basal sheaths 0.8\\endash{}1.2 mm diameter about 7 mm below summit; panicle 7\\endash{}11 cm long; basal leaf diameter (long axis) (0.3\\endash{})0.5\\endash{}0.7 mm diameter, plant thus fine in aspect; leaves plicate, hexagonal, involute (near midleaf), usually with 5 nerves, the ribs (adaxial side) densely long pubescent; range in Canada, east of the Cascade Mountains... subsp. \\i{}idahoensis\\i0{} \\par{}Basal sheaths 1.0\\endash{}1.4 mm diameter about 7 mm below summit; panicle 9.5\\endash{}16.0 cm long; basal leaf diameter (long axis)(0.5\\endash{})0.6\\endash{}0.9(\\endash{}1.2) mm, plant thus coarse in aspect; leaves obovate-pyriform in cross section (near midleaf) with margins tending to open, usually with 7 nerves, the ribs (adaxial side) lightly scabrous to sparsely short pubescent; range in Canada, west of the Cascade Mountains (southeastern Vancouver Island and Gulf Islands)...subsp. \\i{}roemeri\\i0{}\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Festuca lenensis\\i0{} has been known as: \\i{}F. ovina\\i0{} var. \\i{}alaskana\\i0{} Holmen (Hultén 1968, Porsild and Cody 1980), \\i{}F. auriculata\\i0{} Drobow (Frederiksen 1983), \\i{}F. lenensis\\i0{} Drobow (\\i{}F. ovina\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}alaskana\\i0{} Holmen pro parte; Aiken and Darbyshire 1990). \\par{}As a result of isozyme analyses and the examination of the type specimens of \\i{}F. auriculata\\i0{} and \\i{}F. lenensis\\i0{}, the name \\i{}F\\i0{}. agg. \\i{}auriculata\\i0{} was used by Aiken et al. (1993) following Tzvelev (1976). The study was based on specimens from the Northern Yukon and the suggestion was made that plants from this location may have been sufficiently isolated from Russian plants to have speciated to a distinct subspecies. No further work has been done on this suggestion and the name \\i{}F. lenensis\\i0{} is used, as the Yukon plants are considered closer to the type of that name. Three collections from Alaska sent in by David Murray, University of Alaska, had the leaf anatomy of \\i{}F. auriculata\\i0{} s.s., but they had grown in very harsh environments. Until further evidence is available, they are considered to be stunted plants of \\i{}F. lenensis\\i0{} that had a very short growing season. \\par{}In some DELTA analyses the similarity of \\i{}F. lenensis\\i0{} to the introduced \"pseudovina\" (\\i{}F. valesiaca\\i0{} Schleich. ex Gaud. s.l.) of the grass seed trade is evident. Both are diploid species (possibly sister taxa) that occur naturally in the fescue steppes of the southeastern Altai where they are valuable forage, particularly in the spring (Dulepova 1986, Namzalov 1986).\u003e","\u003cFrederiksen (1979) considered \\i{}F. minutiflora\\i0{} a neglected species. She mapped the distribution and since that time we have found more specimens particularly in Canada (Argus and Aiken 1987, Aiken and Darbyshire 1990). While agreeing with Frederiksen (1979) that \\i{}F. brevifolia\\i0{} var. \\i{}utahensis\\i0{} St.-Yves is synonymous with \\i{}F. minutiflora\\i0{}, we suggest that \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} var. \\i{}endotera\\i0{} (St.-Yves) Litard. is synonymous with \\i{}F. earlei\\i0{} Rydb. (see the notes for \\i{}F. earlei\\i0{}). \\par{}Frederiksen (1979) included \\i{}F. brevifolia\\i0{} var. \\i{}utahensis\\i0{} in \\i{}F. minutiflora\\i0{} \"only with some hesitation\". She noted that \"the top of the caryopsis is hairy, but it deviates, especially in having more florets per spikelet and broader leaves. However, there are transitional specimens even among the few specimens examined.\" Both \\i{}F. minutiflora\\i0{} and \\i{}F. earlei\\i0{} show phenotypic plasticity with evidence on herbarium labels suggesting that small and large plants have often come from different microhabitats at the same location (\\i{}Baker 175 and 176\\i0{} collections). Large specimens of \\i{}F. minutiflora\\i0{} approach the dimensions of small to medium size specimens of \\i{}F. earlei\\i0{}, but have a finer more delicate form when the two species are compared. The degree of this difference is indicated in that large specimens of \\i{}F. earlei\\i0{} are sufficiently robust to have been identified as \\i{}F. rubra\\i0{}, while many specimens of \\i{}F. minutiflora\\i0{} have previously been identified as \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} Schult. \u0026 Schult. f. \\par{}Rydberg (1905) gave the ligule length for \\i{}F. minutiflora\\i0{} as 0.75 mm, but all specimens examined to date have ligules less than 0.5 mm long. Ligules in \\i{}F. earlei\\i0{} are 0.1-1.0 mm long.\u003e","\u003cIn the above description, data for Canadian specimens (Aiken and Darbyshire 1990) are combined with data gathered from Californian specimens (Aiken 1993) and encompass the size ranges found in this species throughout North America. \\par{}Hitchcock et al. (1969) commented that, \"although sometimes approaching \\i{}F. idahoensis\\i0{} this species is nearly always recognizable from the former by the smaller lemmas, some of which are always exceeded by the awn\". The fine leaves of \\i{}F. occidentalis\\i0{} are angular in outline from fine bundles of underlying sclerenchyma, those of \\i{}F. idahoensis\\i0{} Elmer s.l. are more rounded in outline from wide bands of underlying sclerenchyma (Aiken and Consaul 1995). The ovary apices of plants of \\i{}F. occidentalis\\i0{} are densely hairy, those of plants of \\i{}F. idahoensis\\i0{} are glabrous.\u003e","\u003cThis European introduction has apparently been grown to a limited extent at Agricultural Experimental Stations, particularly in the U.S.A., and seeded at ski areas. It is reported that seed of \\i{}F. ovina\\i0{} was ordered by Rocky Mountain National Park personnel from a Turkish source (or perhaps seeds of a cultivar from there), to revegetate the degraded roadside along Trail Ridge in the park (W.A. Weber 1995, personal communication). \\par{}Alexeev (1982) having indicated that the species was not considered to occur in North America, discusses a single specimen collected in Illinois (Pialt Co., Allerton Park near Monticells, 31 May 1959, \\i{}G.N.

Members of the \\i{}F. rubra\\i0{} complex may be identified by the presence of young tiller sheaths that are fused in a tube almost to the top (Stace et al. 1992). One may be alerted to look for this character if the sheaths are reddish brown with retrorse hairs and the older sheaths are fibrillose. Leaf cross sections of the \\i{}F. rubra\\i0{} complex are characteristic (Aiken and Consaul 1995). \\par{}In the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) list of Cultivars Eligible for Certification (1993), 211 cultivars of red fescue from thirteen countries in Europe and North America are listed. \\i{}Festuca rubra\\i0{} has been introduced or bred to produce new cultivars throughout North America many times, particularly in regions from Oregon in the south, to the Peace River District of Alberta in the north. The taxonomy of the \\i{}F. rubra\\i0{} complex in northwestern North America was examined by Pavlick (1985) who stated that the taxa, that he recognized, intergrade morphologically. It has not been possible to apply his treatment, that was developed for British Columbia, to the variation within \\i{}F. rubra\\i0{} s.l. that is observed in the whole of North America. \\par{}Attempts were made to separate an Atlantic coastal subspecies, based on plants that appear to be a slender creeping red fescue and relatively salt tolerant. Much of the Atlantic coast has been farmed for more than two centuries and it was found that distinctions between native and introduced plants could not be made satisfactorily based on herbarium material. It is understood that Martin Dubé and coauthors (Dubé and Morisset 1983, 1987, 1995, Dubé, et al., 1985) are working on the problem.\u003e","\u003cOn the holotype specimen of this taxon is a folded letter from E. Hackel to C.V. Piper dated 6 Jan. 1903. It reads as follows, with (?) indicating handwritten words that could not be interpreted. \\par{}\"Dear Sir, \\par{}Your letter of Dec. 18, 1902 was followed yesterday by the parcel containing two specimens of \\i{}F. rubra\\i0{} from California. The specimen gathered at Fort Bragg (\\i{}Davy 6107\\i0{}) is quite identical with \\i{}Festuca rubra\\i0{} subvar. \\i{}pruinosa\\i0{} Hack. in Report of the Bot. Exchange Club of the British Isles for the year 1884, p. 119 (folia pruinose, panicula anjusta, zisculo (?) (?) glabree, (?) pubescentes). This was collected first in the isle of Sky by Linton (?), afterwards I received it from other British coast localities (??? geography) and from the coast of N. France (Bretagne, lg. Crie (?)). The other specimen, from Crescent City (\\i{}Davy \u0026 Blasdale 5931\\i0{}) though very similar to the first has not the stratum of wax on the leaves, which makes one of the characters of subvar. \\i{}pruinosa\\i0{}, giving them the pruninous aspect. The leaves of the Crescent City plant seem also somewhat glaucous, but only in consequence of the (?) epidermis. It therefore cannot be identified with subvar. \\i{}pruinosa\\i0{}, but must get a new subvarietal name. Now I find that there is little difference between your specimen \\i{}Davy + Blasdale 5931\\i0{} and Howell\u0027s Pacif. Coast Pl. (? 1882 no. 74 (76?) (labelled \\i{}F. ovina\\i0{} v. \\i{}rubra\\i0{} Gray) and some others of Pringles gathered 1882 on the Coast of California, Mendocino County, which I named in letters to Prof. Scribner: \\i{}F. rubra\\i0{} var. \\i{}densiuscula\\i0{}, but without publishing this name. Pringle specimen (I noted no number, only the year 1882, of which I have not example in my herbarium, but which I sent back to Prof. Scribner) must have been (after the notes I took from it) quite the same as yours (\\i{}5931\\i0{}). Howell\u0027s is somewhat different by the awned fertile glumes, less stiff leaves. You may use for your \\i{}5931\\i0{} the name \\i{}densiuscula\\i0{} or \\i{}densiflora\\i0{} as you like. \\par{}It is evident that there is much variety in the forms of \\i{}rubra\\i0{}, especially in the coast forms of it and it may perhaps be superfluous to keep all of them with special names. In the sense of my \\i{}Monographie Festucarum\\i0{} your two specimens might also be united under \\i{}rubra juncea\\i0{}, but in this case the character of that must be enlarged to enclose also the forms with tight panicles. \\par{}I shall always be ready to give you any information on grasses you desire and I shall also make use of your offer to exchange rare species of N. Am. Grasses with those of S. America etc. Mr. Hitchcock will tell you, that I spoke with him (when he called on me here) regarding a large collection of Grasses that I might sell to the Nat. Herbarium. I had not yet the time to go over the whole collection and to complete it (?) types from my herbarium but I shall do so in the lapse of the next month (or 2 months) and then I shall make an offer containing all the number of species and specimens. \\par{}Yours ever truly, \\par{}E. Hackel.\" \\par{}Aiken and Fedak (1992) reported a chromosome count of 2\\i{}n\\i0{}\u003d42 obtained for a plant from California, Humbolt County, Fort Bragg, beside the estuary of the Albion River at a Biological Field Station. The plant was one of several growing 2-4 m from the tide line, 12 August 1988, (\\i{}S.G. Aiken, 88-438\\i0{}. CAN 534351 and 534318). The evidence from the SDS-PAGE analyses of seed proteins (Aiken et al. 1992), suggested that this taxon is closely related to commercial cultivars of \\i{}F. rubra\\i0{} s.l. and better treated as a subspecies. \\par{}In the sand dunes of northern California and southern Oregon there is an apparently native member of the \\i{}F. rubra\\i0{} s.l. complex that is adapted to saline, sand dune habitats. It differs from commercial \\i{}F. rubra\\i0{} cultivars in having distinctive glaucous blue foliage that is firm to the touch from underlying well-developed sclerenchyma strands. Another conspicuous difference distinguishing it from commercial \\i{}F. rubra\\i0{} is that the spikelets have almost awnless lemmas. When grown in the greenhouse, plants developed vivid red leaf sheaths. When plants grow in the unstable moving substrate of seashores and dunes and also when they are grown under greenhouse conditions, they develop vigorous stolons up to 30 cm long. In situations where they were growing between a rock and a well-trodden path, or between rocks, plants were observed to be almost caespitose (\\i{}S.G. Aiken 88-436\\i0{}, contrasted with \\i{}88-437\\i0{}). While the vigour of the stolon development suggests a strong creeping red fescue, the diameter of the stolon is characteristic of a slender creeping red fescue cultivar (D. Huff, Crop Science Dept., Rutgers University, personal communication 1991). At the Biological Field Station at the estuary of the Albon River, commercial \\i{}F. rubra\\i0{} had been planted for turf. However, around the borders of the lawn it had been undisturbed and in August 1988 was observed to be flowering. No evidence of hybridization was observed between the planted cultivar and the native member of the complex that appeared to have flowered much earlier in the season, even where the plants grew within 3 m of each other. \\par{}Alexeev (1982) recognized \\i{}F. densiuscula\\i0{} (Hack. ex Piper) E. B. Alexeev and also \\i{}F. rubra\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}arenicola\\i0{} E. B. Alexeev as a second Californian littoral member of the \\i{}F. rubra\\i0{} complex. The two taxa were said to differ in the degree of openness of the panicle, the degree of scabrousness of the panicle branches, lemma lengths, and the glaucousness of the leaves. After growing plants from near the type locality of \\i{}F. rubra\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}arenicola\\i0{} in the greenhouse for 3 years, examining the collections of coastal \\i{}F. rubra\\i0{} from the herbaria at CAS and UC, and making some observations of plants growing along the Californian coast, Aiken suggests that there is only one native littoral taxon in northern California. The morphological variation recorded appears to be related to habitat, varying with the degree of exposure to the prevailing wind, how much the sand dunes are moving, and whether the plants grow on or near rocks. The amount of leaf sclerenchyma and the degree of leaf folding appear to vary with the salinity and dryness of the habitat, but even in greenhouse conditions the leaves were observed to remain folded, glaucous, and usually had more sclerenchyma developed in the leaf cross sections than is usual for commercial cultivars of \\i{}F. rubra\\i0{} (Aiken and Fedak 1991).\u003e","\u003cTzvelev (1976) questioned whether this is the same taxon as \\i{}F. rubra\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}arctica\\i0{}. Alexeev (1985) placed \\i{}F. rubra\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}richardsonii\\i0{} into synonymy with subsp. \\i{}arctica\\i0{}. While Aiken and Darbyshire (1990) recognized \\i{}F. richardsonii\\i0{}, Aiken et al. (1992) discussed reasons for recognizing the taxon as a subspecies, but did not study Eurasian specimens. \\par{}\\i{}Festuca rubra\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}richardsonii\\i0{} has limited distribution in the western arctic islands, with several records from Victoria Island and small islands nearby. The collection from Melville Island \\i{}S.A. Edlund 379A\\i0{} was from an area well used by muskoxen. The suggestion that it has been found on Devon Island at Truelove Inlet, was made by A. Elveakk, University of Tromso, but no voucher has been seen (personal communicaton 1991).\u003e","\u003cWhether distinctions between \\i{}Festuca brachyphylla\\i0{} Schult. \u0026 Schult. f. and \\i{}F. saximontana\\i0{} deserve species status has been debated. Hultén (1942) reduced the taxon to \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}saximontana\\i0{} based on anther length, but Hultén (1968) recognized the taxon as a full species. Frederiksen (1982) stressed that \\i{}F. saximontana\\i0{} deviates from \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} and related taxa in having strongly developed sclerenchyma in the leaf blades and anthers normally longer than 1.2 mm. Gleason and Cronquist (1991) treated \\i{}F. saximontana\\i0{} with varietal status as \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} var. \\i{}rydbergii\\i0{} (St.-Yves) Cronquist. This was on the basis that Cronquist could not see a difference between the taxa (personal communication 1990). \\par{}On the NY type specimen of \\i{}F. saximontana\\i0{}, W.A. Weber of the University of Colorado Museum, Boulder, Colorado, 9 November 1966, wrote, \"Hultén (1942) reduced this to subspecific rank under \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} Schultes. Holmen (1964) showed that the type (this specimen) has long anthers and hence could not belong to \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} but showed some close affinity to the Eurasian \\i{}F. trachyphylla\\i0{}. \\par{}Although I can not vouch for the separation of \\i{}F. saximontana\\i0{} from \\i{}F. trachyphylla\\i0{}, I support Holmen\u0027s contention that \\i{}F. saximontana\\i0{} has little in common with \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} and for the time being I feel should be maintained at specific rank. The following diagnostic key serves to distinguish the two. \\par{}Anthers 1.0-1.5 mm long; leaves glaucous; culms tall, about 2 to 3 times the height of the basal leaves; ligule conspicuous, 0.3 mm long; lemma 6.0-7.5 mm. long inclusive of the awn; plants of lower and middle foothill to subalpine. ...\\i{}F. saximontana\\i0{} \\par{}Anthers 0.7-0.8 mm long; leaves green; culms usually less than twice the height of the basal leaves; ligule minute or obsolete; lemma 3-4 mm long inclusive of the awn. ..\\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{}. \\par{}In addition to the characters cited above, the more extensive sclerenchyma development in the leaves of \\i{}saximontana\\i0{}, mentioned by Holmen, give the blades a rigidity and resistance to crumpling which sets is apart from \\i{}brachyphylla\\i0{}. In \\i{}brachyphylla\\i0{} the leaves are more often collapsed between the nerves and easily folded or crumpled.\" \\par{}Although the two species are normally quite distinct, some early season collections may be difficult to determine. In the northern areas of the range of \\i{}F. saximontana\\i0{}, there are specimens that have been collected with the characters: anther lengths, leaf dimensions in cross sections, and sclerenchyma development, that overlap with \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}brachyphylla\\i0{} (locations for example in St. Elias Mountains, southwest Yukon; Great Bear Lake, N.W.T. and James Bay, Ontario and Quebec). Larger specimens of \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}brachyphylla\\i0{}, may grow up to 55 cm tall in lush conditions, a height more common in plants of \\i{}F. saximontana\\i0{}. When there are limited habitat data on herbarium labels, identification often is a challenge. \\par{}In a study of candidate specimens to confirm the record of \\i{}F. saximontana\\i0{} on Baffin Island, N.W.T., the first author concluded that the single specimen recorded from Iqaluit, Baffin Island, N.W.T. (annotated by S. Frederiksen, housed at CAN and mapped by Aiken and Darbyshire 1990) is a tall specimen of \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{}. This species is sensitive to nitrogen loads randomly applied in microhabitats and which may result in plants twice the size of an adjacent \"typical\" \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{}. Isozyme studies and SDS-PAGE of the seed proteins have failed to produce evidence that \\i{}F. saximontana\\i0{} occurs in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (Aiken et al. 1992, 1993, and 1995). Data on herbarium labels and field observations suggests that taller plants of \\i{}F. saximontana\\i0{} occur at lower elevations and in more sheltered habitats. The development of purple coloration in spikelets, of this taxon and others in the genus, is often associated with exposed alpine or arctic habitats. An albino form of \\i{}F. saximontana\\i0{} has been observed, but this has not been taxonomically recognized (cf. \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} forma \\i{}flavida\\i0{} Polunin). \\par{}In studying the leaf anatomy, Aiken and Consaul (1995) found that in \\i{}F. saximontana\\i0{} the sclerenchyma is in broad bands, that are sometimes almost continuous. Rarely the sclerenchyma is reduced to three bands at the midrib and leaf margins, such that the leaf cross sections looks superficially like \\i{}F. lenensis\\i0{} Drobow or \\i{}F. valesiaca\\i0{} Schleicher ex Gaud. Leaf cross sections with only three bands of sclerenchyma were observed among specimens collected towards the southern end of the distribution range of \\i{}F. saximontana\\i0{} in the United States.\u003e","\u003cThe descriptive data are based on specimens from alpine regions of Oregon and California. Seed protein data suggested that \\i{}F. saximontana\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}purpusiana\\i0{} is distinct from short forms of \\i{}F. saximontana\\i0{} Rydb. subsp. \\i{}saximontana\\i0{} (Aiken et al. 1992). In that study, the protein profile determined by SDS-PAGE analyses of \\i{}F. saximontana\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}purpusiana\\i0{} seed obtained from the White Mountains of California was compared with the profiles of samples of subsp. \\i{}saximontana\\i0{} and \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} Schult. \u0026 Schult. f. obtained from across Canada. The profile of the subsp. \\i{}purpusiana\\i0{} lacked a heavily stained band that was present in six samples of subsp. \\i{}saximontana\\i0{} from widely separated areas in North America. Instead the profile of subsp. \\i{}purpusiana\\i0{} had two narrow bands more similar to those that were found in the same position on \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} profiles. The seed protein results might have suggested recognition of \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}purpusiana\\i0{}, but the morphological characteristics of anther lengths and sclerenchyma deposition in leaf cross sections are more similar to \\i{}F. saximontana\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}saximontana\\i0{}. \\par{}\\i{}Festuca brachyphylla\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}coloradensis\\i0{} (\u003d\\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}breviculmis\\i0{}) plants were growing in association with \\i{}F. saximontana\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}purpusiana\\i0{} at a White Mountain site in California. They were visibly much shorter, more compact, and at a different stage of flowering (photographs in the image library). It is suggested that \\i{}F. saximontana\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}purpusiana\\i0{}, like \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}coloradensis\\i0{} has evolved at high altitudes and in relative isolation in the south western United States (Aiken et al. 1992). As both subsp. \\i{}saximontana\\i0{} and subsp. \\i{}purpusiana\\i0{} have 2\\i{}n\\i0{}\u003d42 chromosomes, they are more likely to be able to hybridize if they grow together. It is suspected from herbarium label data that the two subspecies are separated by altitude differences in many locations, with subsp. \\i{}saximontana\\i0{} in dry grasslands below a forest zone and subsp. \\i{}purpusiana\\i0{} isolated on the tops of mountains above 3000 m, but this needs more research. \\par{}The confusion is reflected in the literature. Tzvelev (1976) indicated that the taxon is known from Chukotsk Peninsula in Asia, an extension that corresponds well with the extension of other Beringian plants, and he recognized \\i{}F. purpusiana\\i0{} (St.-Yves) Tzvelev. Alexeev (1985) stated that, in North America, subsp. \\i{}purpusiana\\i0{} is an ecological response of \\i{}F. saximontana\\i0{} where less sclerenchyma forms in the leaves and refers the Asian material of \\i{}F. purpusiana\\i0{} sensu Tzvelev to \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{}. \\par{}Frederiksen (1982) based the name \\i{}F. saximontana\\i0{} var. \\i{}purpusiana\\i0{} on the \\i{}Cusick 2454\\i0{} type, collected in mountains of eastern Oregon, and made the combination in collaboration with L.E. Pavlick. She suggested that the two varieties deviate in (a) the length of the culm, which is distinctly shorter in the taxon she recognized as var. \\i{}purpusiana\\i0{} and (b) the length of the culms relative to the length of the blades (culms are about twice the length of the blades in \"var.\" \\i{}purpusiana\\i0{} and more than twice the length of the blades in var. \\i{}saximontana\\i0{}). The first author has found these characters to be very variable, both on herbarium specimens and in the course of field work. Frederiksen\u0027s observations, based on a few specimens only, were that the leaf sheath is never fused more than 1/3 in var. \\i{}saximontana\\i0{}, while it is fused 1/2 or more in var. \\i{}purpusiana\\i0{}. Frederiksen concluded that although there seems to be real differences between the taxa concerning the fusion of the leaf sheaths, there are difficulties in distinguishing between them. \\par{}The only two diagnostic characters given by St.-Yves (1925) are the colour of the spikelets (normally green or reddish in subsp. \\i{}saximontana\\i0{} and mostly green variegated, with purple in subsp. \\i{}purpusiana\\i0{}) and the fusion of the leaf sheath (at most 1/4 fused in subsp. \\i{}saximontana\\i0{}, 1/3-1/2 fused in subsp. \\i{}purpusiana\\i0{}). Some authors have emphasized the amount of sheath closure as a taxonomic character in separating the segregated taxa subsp. \\i{}saximontana\\i0{}, subsp. \\i{}purpusiana\\i0{}, var. \\i{}robertsiana\\i0{} Pavlick, and \\i{}F. canadensis\\i0{} E. B. Alexeev (Alexeev 1983, Frederiksen 1982). \\par{}During development a \"split ring\" develops in the sheaths of subsp. \\i{}saximontana\\i0{} (Aiken and Darbyshire 1990, illustrated in the image library) It is suspected that the rate of growth of the new shoot coming up through the sheath may influence how rapidly this split opens. The first author\u0027s experience and that of Pils (1985), is that this feature is highly variable in most fescues. It can be difficult to determine the difference between 1/4, 1/3, or 1/2 sheath closure in arctic or alpine species that have short sheaths. Lui and Dengler (1992), in an anatomical study, found that the early stages of development of the closed sheaths of \\i{}F. rubra\\i0{} s.l. and the open sheaths of \\i{}F. trachyphylla\\i0{} (Hack.) Krajina had many similarities. The work of these authors appeared to imply that differences in sheath development between closely related taxa may be difficult to detect, if plants are grown under uniform conditions, that is, the character, degree of sheath opening, may have a phenotypic component. \\par{}Aiken and Darbyshire (1990) also noted that a number of collections of \\i{}F. saximontana\\i0{} from subalpine and alpine habitats of southern Alberta and British Columbia retained their small stature and dense tufts under uniform cultivation in Ottawa. The variety recognized by Pavlick (1984), i.e. var. \\i{}robertsiana\\i0{}, described from the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia, is intermediate in culm length between the taxa recognized by Frederiksen (1982) as var. \\i{}saximontana\\i0{} and var. \\i{}purpusiana\\i0{} and is placed into synonymy with \\i{}F. saximontana\\i0{}.\u003e","\u003cAn Eurasian native that is widely introduced in North America as \"hard\", \"sheep\", or \"ovina\" fescue for land stabilization on pipelines, mine tailings, ski slopes, and roadside plantings. It has been observed planted on mine tailings in Sudbury, Ontario, on ground disturbed by the Alaskan pipeline project through Alberta, and on ski slopes in the Appalachian Mountains. \\par{}McNeill and Dore (1976) discussed this species under the name \\i{}F. longifolia\\i0{} and explained that although it is definitely related to \\i{}F. ovina\\i0{}, the type of \\i{}F. duriuscula\\i0{} L. is a member of the \\i{}F. rubra\\i0{} group and so the epithet cannot be applied in this sense. While they were aware that Tzvelev (1972b) had adopted the name \\i{}F. trachyphylla\\i0{} they referred to other European authors Auquier (1973) and Kerguélen (1975) who retained the name \\i{}F. longifolia\\i0{} for at least part of \\i{}F. duriuscula\\i0{} auct. Markgraf-Dannenberg (1980), followed Tzvelev (1972b, 1976) and adopted the name \\i{}F. trachyphylla\\i0{} for hexaploid plants of the complex. Kerguélen, when he visited Ottawa in the early 1980\u0027s, annotated plants collected in Quebec as \\i{}F. trachyphylla\\i0{} and stated that \\i{}F. longifolia\\i0{} is a more delicate, diploid species with limited distribution on sandy acidic soils in coastal western Europe, southern Britain, and northwestern and central Europe. \\par{}Alexeev (1975) described \\i{}F. trachyphylla\\i0{} as an anthropogenic, introgressive, hybrid species of \\i{}F. valesiaca\\i0{} Schleich. ex Gaud. × \\i{}F. ovina\\i0{} L. \\par{}Wilkinson and Stace (1989) selected a lectotype for the name \\i{}F. ovina\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}eu-ovina\\i0{} var. \\i{}duriuscula\\i0{} subvar. \\i{}trachyphylla\\i0{} Hack. but pointed to the combination \\i{}F. trachyphylla\\i0{} Hack. ex Druce, which is an earlier homonym of \\i{}F. trachyphylla\\i0{} (Hack.) Krajina. Wilkinson and Stace (1989) rejected the latter name in favour of \\i{}F. brevipila\\i0{} Tracey. The use of the \"trachyphylla\" epithet by Druce appears to have been an unintended slip for the epithet \"trachylepis\" and, although not corrected, was never repeated in his later works. Additionally, the grammatical construction and use of pronouns in the protologue is ambiguous and the diagnosis provided is not clearly attached to the name \\i{}F. trachyphylla\\i0{}. The interpretation of \\i{}F. trachyphylla\\i0{} Hack. ex Druce as nomen nudum is adopted here (based on extensive work by S. J. Darbyshire, personal communication 1995 and quoted here with his permission). \\par{}Lui and Dengler (1992) in an anatomical study found that the early stages of development of the closed sheaths of \\i{}F. rubra\\i0{} s.l. and the open sheaths of \\i{}F. trachyphylla\\i0{} had many similarities. Darbyshire and Warwick (1992) were unable to distinguished the chloroplast DNA of the two taxa.\u003e","\u003c\\i{}Festuca valesiaca\\i0{} is an European species sold under the trade name \"pseudovina\", apparently to a limited extent in North America. The species has been grown experimentally in New Jersey at Rutgers University, in New York at Ithaca, in Washington State at Pullman, and as a lawn grass in Kansas, Saline County. Records indicate that it has been planted in Lincoln County, Wyoming, Carbon County, Montana, and in the Kaibab National Forest, Arizona. A record from the Yukon was found by S.J. Darbyshire (Canada: N.W.T.: 10 km south of Mackenzie Highway, 61°17\u0027N, 120°56\u0027W, hummocky till, moraine, boreal mixed woods, elevation 800 ft. Revegetation trial No. 17.

Barbara Wilson has drawn our attention to four specimens from Vermont in the Pringle herbarium (VT). \\par{}The taxon is distinguished from other introduced \\i{}Festuca\\i0{} species by the leaf cross sections that have heavy sclerenchyma only at the midrib and leaf margins and in these respects are similar to the leaf sections of \\i{}F. lenensis\\i0{}, and rarely to leaves of \\i{}F. saximontana\\i0{} Rydb. \\par{}\\i{}Festuca valesiaca\\i0{} occurs naturally in the fescue steppes of the southeastern Altai and the Dauria steppe of the Transbaikal region where it is a valuable forage, particularly in the spring (Dulepova 1986, Namzalov 1986). Both \\i{}F. valesiaca\\i0{} and \\i{}F. lenensis\\i0{} are dominant grasses in steppes of southern Chunya, although \\i{}F. valesiaca\\i0{} appears to be more important and widespread. Tzvelev (1976) considered subsp. \\i{}valesiaca\\i0{} a more xerophilic taxon than subsp. \\i{}pseudovina\\i0{}. \\par{}The taxonomic confusion surrounding the name \\i{}F. valesiaca\\i0{} and the taxa recognized within the complex are indicated by the 36 entries associated with the name in Chase and Niles (1962). Tzvelev (1976) recognized \\i{}F. valesiaca\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}valesiaca\\i0{} and \\i{}F. valesiaca\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}pseudovina\\i0{}; Markgraf-Dannenberg (1980) considered the latter to be a full species \\i{}F. pseudovina\\i0{}. The taxon is not well understood in North America.\u003e","\u003cPavlick (1983c) documented confusion over the lectotype of this species and explained that Vasey\u0027s (1893a) selection was correct. He documented that Piper (1906) misinterpreted the protologue in Vasey (1893b) and selected a specimen collected by Bolander in California as the type; he was followed by Hitchcock and Chase (1951). \\par{}A taxon that has been placed into synonymy with \\i{}F. viridula\\i0{} is \\i{}F. howellii\\i0{} Hack. ex Beal, (Grasses N.

Whether this type is a specimen of \\i{}F. viridula\\i0{} is the subject of a study by B.L. Wilson (personal communication, 1995). \\par{}\\i{}F. viridula\\i0{} was described as intermediate to \\i{}F. idahoensis\\i0{} var. \\i{}oregona\\i0{} Hack. ex Beal (Hitchcock et al. 1969). These authors commented that \\i{}F. viridula\\i0{} \"approaches \\i{}F. idahoensis\\i0{}, especially the var. \\i{}oregona\\i0{} but differs not only because of the unawned or only awn-tipped lemmas, but also because of the flat blades and the marcescent fibrous veins of the sheaths, in this respect resembling \\i{}F. rubra\\i0{}\". It differs from both these species in having ovaries with dense pubescence at the apex. The sheaths of \\i{}F. viridula\\i0{} s.s. remain entire; those of \\i{}F. washingtonica\\i0{} are marcescent (see notes under the latter species). \\par{}Where it occurs, particularly in the United States, this species is an important alpine and subalpine forage that is highly palatable and nutritious.\u003e","\u003cFollowing Frederiksen (1982) and Alexeev (1985) the species and subspecies recognized by Pavlick (1984) are treated as synonymous. Pavlick (1984) speculated on the hybrid origin of this taxon as \\i{}F. baffinensis\\i0{} Polunin × \\i{}F. brachyphylla\\i0{} Schult. \u0026 Schult. f. Both the postulated parents occur on Ellesmere Island and in the western cordillera. Some of the nine specimens at CAN from the western cordillera, annotated by Pavlick as \\i{}F. viviparoidea\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}krajinae\\i0{}, have rhizomes. This suggests one of the parents may be a member of \\i{}F. rubra\\i0{} s.l., possibly \\i{}F. rubra\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}richardsonii\\i0{} (Hook.) Hultén, as hairs occur on the lemmas of \\i{}F. viviparoidea\\i0{}. There is a diversity in the leaf cross sections of plants from this area (observed by S. Aiken among specimens at CAN) and illustrated by Alexeev (1985). \\par{}The name \\i{}F. vivipara\\i0{} was applied in North America to any fescue of the \\i{}ovina\\i0{} group with proliferating spikelets (Hitchcock and Chase 1951, Boivin 1967, Scoggan 1978). \\i{}Festuca vivipara\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}vivipara\\i0{} is an old-world taxon not known from North America. A polyphyletic origin for this taxon is suggested by the diversity of morphological forms, leaf cross section anatomy, and the chromosome numbers. It has been suggested that the viviparous \\i{}Festuca\\i0{} may be species complexes of hybrid origin that persist by means of vegetative proliferation or \"vivipary\" (Flovik 1938, Tzvelev 1972b, Siplivinskii 1973, Frederiksen 1981, and Pavlick 1984). For further discussion of viviparous fescues see Aiken et al. (1987) and Aiken and Darbyshire (1990).\u003e","\u003cDescribed as a new species by Alexeev (1982) but not widely taken up. The specimens examined by the first author and SDS-PAGE analyses of seed proteins confirm that this is a distinct species. \\par{}When Alexeev (1982) recognized this taxon, he commented, that \"in habit and anatomical structure of the leaf blades, this species resembles \\i{}F. rubra\\i0{}. However, within the limits of the very polymorphous latter species, we do not know of a single taxon with leaf blades that are externally scabrous, as in \\i{}F. washingtonica\\i0{}, which has trichomes up to 0.08 mm long.\" Alexeev (1982) cited as the type specimen, a plant that had been collected on 3 June 1960 and he described the ovary apex as glabrous. Alexeev appears to have examined only one specimen and that of a plant collected so early in the growing season that the ovaries were too small to have developed apical hairs. \\par{}Specimens of this taxon may sometimes have been labelled \\i{}F. viridula\\i0{} Vasey or \\i{}F. rubra\\i0{}. (Specimens examined: the isotype, and specimens from U.S.A. Washington: Benton Co., growing in a narrow strip just below the tip of Rattlesnake Mountain in the snowmelt zone, in rocky silt loan, with \\i{}Artemisia tridentata\\i0{}, \\i{}Lupinus laxiflorus\\i0{} var. \\i{}calcaratus\\i0{}, \\i{}Poa nevadensis\\i0{}, \\i{}Senecio integerrimus\\i0{}, \\i{}Festuca idahoensis\\i0{}, \\i{}Melica bulbosa\\i0{} and \\i{}Poa cusickii\\i0{}, elevation 3400 feet, 4 June 1995, (and from the same site later in the season) \\i{}Kathryn Beck \u0026 Florence Caplow 95088\\i0{}). \\par{}Hitchcock et al. (1969) when discussing \\i{}F. viridula\\i0{} commented on the \"marcescent fibrous veins of the sheaths\". This is a characteristic of \\i{}F. washingtonica\\i0{} which has closed sheaths; those in \\i{}F. viridula\\i0{} are open. The concept of \\i{}F. viridula\\i0{} in Hitchcock et al. (1969) may have covered both taxa. \\i{}Festuca washingtonica\\i0{} differs from \\i{}F. viridula\\i0{} in having closed sheaths, extravaginal shoots, and abaxial to adaxial sclerenchyma strands in the leaves, illustrated by Alexeev (1982). Both species have mature ovaries with dense hairs at the apex.\u003e","\u003cThere has been constant agreement that this is a distinct species (Pavlick and Looman 1984, Alexeev 1985, Harms 1985, Aiken and Darbyshire 1990, Gleason and Cronquist 1991). Characters useful for distinguishing this species from other rough fescues are in the notes for \\i{}F. campestris\\i0{} Rydb.\u003e","\u003c\\i{}F. hitchcockiana\\i0{} E. B. Alexeev was distinguished from \\i{}F. californica\\i0{} by the characters, ligule length (longer in \\i{}F. hitchcockiana\\i0{}), and the absence of collar hairs (\\i{}F. hitchcockiana\\i0{}). Collar hairs vary in abundance from dense to almost absent, even on the same plants. Only one specimen with conspicuously long ligules (1-4 mm) was found, by S. Aiken, in the course of the study of \\i{}Festuca\\i0{} for the treatment of the genus in \\i{}The Jepson Manual: Higher Plants of California\\i0{} (Aiken 1993). In that treatment, Aiken considered as synonymous \\i{}F. californica\\i0{} and \\i{}F. californica\\i0{} var. \\i{}parishii\\i0{} (Piper) Hitchc. Having gathered data from the type specimen of var. \\i{}parishii\\i0{} (illustrated in the image library) and analysed it using INTKEY options with this database, the taxon appears to be a distinct species (Aiken et al. 1997). The taxon is part of an ongoing study.\u003e","\u003cMountain fescue was placed in synonymy with \\i{}F. altaica\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}altaica\\i0{} Trin. by Piper (1906) and St.-Yves (1925). Alexeev (1985) placed mountain fescue into synonymy with \\i{}F. hallii\\i0{} (Vasey) Piper. Harms (1985) gave reasons why the taxon should be treated as a subspecies, \\i{}F. altaica\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}scabrella\\i0{} (Torrey) Hultén, but based the name on a type specimen that is considered, by S. G. Aiken, to be \\i{}F. altaica\\i0{} Trin. (see below). It was considered to be a species, \\i{}F. campestris\\i0{}, by Pavlick and Looman (1984), Aiken and Lefkovitch (1984) and Aiken and Darbyshire (1990). \\par{}The map presented in Aiken and Lefkovitch (1984) and the more detailed maps in Aiken and Consaul (1995) indicate geographic separation among the taxa. Even where maps show the taxa as sympatric, e.g. southern Alberta and British Columbia, the plants are growing at different altitudes, separated by a band of boreal forest; \\i{}F. altaica\\i0{} at tree line or above, \\i{}F. campestris\\i0{} in grassland areas around 1500 m or below. \\par{}Aiken and Lefkovitch (1984) decided the results of an epidermal peel study supported the Looman and Best (1979) concept of three species among the rough fescues occurring in Canada. However, they cautioned that the only measurement found to have potential for separating the taxa, namely the length of the intercostal cells, \"fails to be useful for identification purposes as the ranges of values overlap among the species\". \\par{}An SDS-PAGE study of seed proteins in the genus suggested that the three taxa \\i{}F. altaica\\i0{}, \\i{}F. campestris\\i0{}, and \\i{}F. hallii\\i0{} appear to be closely related (Aiken and Gardiner 1991). The greater number of bands in the seed protein profiles recorded for \\i{}F. campestris\\i0{} when compared with those for \\i{}F. altaica\\i0{} and \\i{}F. hallii\\i0{} indicated that this taxon is not an autoploid of either of them. The possibility that \\i{}F. campestris\\i0{} is an allopolyploid of \\i{}F. altaica\\i0{} × \\i{}F. hallii\\i0{} was considered but could neither be proved nor disproved. \\par{}Leaf morphology is phenotypically plastic and many factors appear to result in reduced numbers of sclerenchyma strands, for example, when the leaves (a) have developed early in the growing season, (b) are relatively long, (c) come from a plant that has grown at high altitudes, (d) have regrown from tussocks that have been burnt or, (e) been severely grazed. This is shown in specimens towards the southern end of the distribution range and well documented in a US collection of specimens from Eastern Washington and Northern Montana. These specimens sometimes have leaves that are similar to those of \\i{}F. hallii\\i0{}, but inflorescences and spikelets of \\i{}F. campestris\\i0{}. The presence of B chromosomes appears to influence leaf width in \\i{}F. altaica\\i0{} (Aiken and Fedak 1992) but whether B chromosomes occur in \\i{}F. campestris\\i0{} has not been established. \\par{}The impact of grazing on vegetative morphology was suspected by C.V. Piper (Piper 1906) who wrote on a specimen, \"Don\u0027t believe this indicates \u0027blades deciduous from the sheath with age\u0027, but that this plant was grazed (underlined twice). The junction of the sheath and blade may be found in the old plant.\" (Specimen: Washington: Kittitas Co., Wenstcha Mountains, 4000 ft, 2 July 1897, \\i{}A.D. Elmer, 460\\i0{}. US 73432). The basal tussock of this specimen has the chewed remains of approximately 15 groups of sheaths that would usually have more than 45 leaves, by July, but has only 14 leaves developing from four of the sheath groups. Etiolation, leading to longer than usual leaves also appears to reduce the number of adaxial to abaxial sclerenchyma strands. (Specimen: Washington: Stepton, May 1900, \\i{}J.R. Vasey 5\\i0{}. US 1005085, a sample with leaves, to 70 cm long and leaf cross sections with only 3 abaxial to adaxial sclerenchyma girders). This is consistent with findings in Aiken and Consaul (1995) that longer leaves in some \\i{}Festuca\\i0{} species tend to become narrower and have less sclerenchyma. Burning may lead to new growth with narrow leaves. (Specimen: Montana: Sanders Co., 5 miles east of Thompson Falls, 21 April, 1934, \\i{}C. L. Hitchcock\\i0{}. US 1730096). The variation observed in leaf anatomy characteristics suggests why Alexeev (1985) in a paper that illustrated leaf cross sections, recognized only \\i{}F. altaica\\i0{} and \\i{}F. hallii\\i0{}. In the course of this study, the taxonomic status of mountain fescue has been reconsidered and examined in analyses run on this database (see Aiken et al. 1997). \\par{}Characteristics found useful for separating the species follow. \\par{}1. The degree of rhizome development. Rhizomes are rarely observed in \\i{}F. altaica\\i0{}, they are short, if present, in \\i{}F. campestris\\i0{} (Johnston and Cosby, 1966) and well developed in \\i{}F. hallii\\i0{}. \\par{}2. Colour differences of the inflorescences. Inflorescences are bluish gray green in \\i{}F. campestris\\i0{} and purplish, or dark purple in \\i{}F. altaica\\i0{}. (There is an albino form, \\i{}F. altaica\\i0{} forma \\i{}pallida\\i0{} Jordal). \\par{}3. The orientation of inflorescence branches. In \\i{}F. altaica\\i0{} these are often blown to one side and slightly drooping, those of \\i{}F. campestris\\i0{} are stiffer and even slightly ascending. \\par{}4. Relative lengths of glumes. The glumes of both species, \\i{}F. altiaca\\i0{} and \\i{}F. campestris\\i0{}, may approach subequal in length but they are usually conspicuously unequal. Also, the upper glume is consistently shorter than the adjacent lemma. These characters contrast with the character states in \\i{}F. hallii\\i0{} spikelets, where the glumes are usually subequal and the upper glume is as long, or longer than the adjacent lemma. \\par{}5. The width and translucency of the glumes and lemma margins. In \\i{}F. altaica\\i0{} these structures have conspicuously translucent borders causing the spikelets to shine in sunlight, those of \\i{}F. campestris\\i0{} have less conspicuously transparent margins and the spikelets are not obviously shiny. \\par{}Harms (1985) discussed type specimens of the name \\i{}F. scabrella\\i0{} Torrey, that were collected by Thomas Drummond \"in alpine districts of the Rocky Mountains\" in 1825 or 1826 on the John Franklin Second Expedition. Harms (1985) concluded that \"unfortunately the quality of the type materials was too inadequate and the spikelets too immature to assure their unequivocal identification as either \\i{}F. altaica\\i0{} sensu stricta or the more southern mountain taxon... Most of the individual plants appear depauperate for either taxon and have rather scanty panicles. Although measurements of the lengths of spikelets, glumes and lemmas fell more into the expected range for \\i{}F. altaica\\i0{} sensu stricta than for the more southern mountain taxon, these are questionably reliable for the particular maturation stages. Coloration of herbage and spikelets was obscure. The rather contracted panicles with mostly ascending-erect upper branches, on the other hand, suggested the latter, as did the relatively inconspicuous glume-borders. Thus, identification of the available type material seemed inconclusive, although I was most inclined to place it with the more southern mountain taxon....\" \\par{}In examining the isotype and possible second isotype collections of Drummond from GH, in 1994, (illustrated in the image library) the first author agreed with the annotations made by L.E. Pavlick (Sept. 1981) that these specimens are plants of \\i{}F. altaica\\i0{} sensu stricta. They are similar to many that she has seen growing below 1000 m in the Northern Yukon. The culms are 28 cm to more than 50 cm high (one long culm has been cut and was obviously longer). One specimen has a flag leaf blade that has dried almost flat and is more than 2 mm wide. The specimens were collected as the inflorescences approached anthesis and the panicles can be described as immature but approaching open and lax; one of the branches has opened up to be at right angles to the main rachis. Spikelets are 10-13 mm long, with 3-5 florets. Most of the colour of the specimens has turned to a dark straw yellow, but the spikelets retain evidence of dark bands of purplish-brown on the lemmas. Some lemmas have conspicuous, translucent borders: on others the borders have inrolled somewhat, as the specimens dried. The lemma lengths range from 7-9.5 mm and rachilla internodes from 1.5-2 mm, making the florets of the spikelet more widely separated than is common in mountain fescue. \\par{}Since he was convinced that the Drummond specimens are more likely plants of mountain fescue, Harms (1985) placed the name \\i{}F. scabrella\\i0{} var. \\i{}major\\i0{} Vasey into synonymy. The type for this name, \\i{}Suksdorf 118\\i0{} has a pressed culm approximately 95 cm long, the leaves, although faded to straw colour, are slightly greyish green, the flag leaf blades are involute. The post-anthesis inflorescence branches are erect and up to 13 cm long, with numerous pairs of unequal glumes: the lower glumes 5-6(-6.5) mm long, the upper glumes 6.5-7(-8) mm long. A leaf cross section had five sclerenchyma girders and anatomy typical of mountain fescue. Rydberg (1900) based the species name \\i{}F. campestris\\i0{} on the \\i{}Suksdoff 118\\i0{} specimen. \\par{}Buffalo bunchgrass produces a large amount of forage and is especially relished by horses and cattle; it is somewhat too hard a grass for sheep. On winter ranges, it is considered one of the best grasses, as it cures well on the stalk and retains its nutritive properties all winter. On the lower ranges, the small amount of snow held against the strong winds in the centre of the grass bunches serves both to moisten and soften the herbage, and is a source of water for the livestock. On the higher ranges, continuously covered by winter snow, this grass greens up faster in the spring and appears to be better relished by livestock than when growing on the lower winter ranges. The high palatability of both the leaves and stalks in many instances has resulted in cropping to the ground line which decreases the abundance of this valuable grass (Dayton 1931).\u003e","\u003cPavlick and Looman (1984), Alexeev (1985) and Aiken and Darbyshire (1990) treated this taxon as a full species. Harms (1985) suggested that this should be treated as \\i{}F. altaica\\i0{} subsp. \\i{}hallii\\i0{} (Vasey) Harms. The decision to continue to recognize this taxon as a full species rather than a subspecies is discussed in the notes for \\i{}F. campestris\\i0{} Rydb.\u003e","\u003cThis taxon has separate female and male plants which has been used to justify treating it as a distinct subgenus or genus. No reason for placing the taxon in a separate genus has been found based on the analyses of this database (Aiken et al. 1997). The taxon is treated here as a \\i{}Festuca\\i0{} based on INTKEY analyses of this database and the results of analyses of seed proteins using SDS-PAGE analyses. There have been discussions as to whether Cassidy ever saw the type of Watson\u0027s \\i{}Poa kingii\\i0{} (S. J. Darbyshire, personal communication 1994).\u003e","\u003cSwallen (1932) considered this species is \"related to \\i{}F. thurberi\\i0{} but differing in its less densely tufted habit, more slender culms, smaller panicles, fewer flowered spikelets and shorter obtuse lemmas\". Analyses using this database, suggest that \\i{}F. ligulata\\i0{} is not as closely related to \\i{}F. thurberi\\i0{} as Swallen implied\u003e","\u003cTreated as synonymous with \\i{}F. californica\\i0{} Vasey, by Aiken (1993). After examining the isotype specimen from GH, in 1994-95, and examining the data analyses in Aiken et al. (1997), this is considered to be a distinct species. There is a photograph of the isotype specimen and diagrams of two leaf cross sections in the image library.\u003e","\u003cThis species is named in honour of its discoverer, Dr. George Thurber (1821-90), botanist and quartermaster of the United States Mexican Boundary Commission (1850). Thurber was a professor of botany and horticulture at Michigan Agricultural College 1859-63 and editor of the American Agriculturalist 1863-90 (Dayton 1913). \\par{}Cronquist et al. (1977) noted that \"\\i{}Festuca thurberi\\i0{} is very closely related to \\i{}F. campestris\\i0{} Rydb. (\u003d\\i{}F. scabrella\\i0{} Torrey in Hook.) and resembles it in all respects except for the prominent ligules and statistically shorter glumes and lemmas\". Not only do the lengths of the ligules and the awns in the two taxa not overlap, but the ligules and glume margins in \\i{}F. thurberi\\i0{} are glabrous and those in \\i{}F. campestris\\i0{} are ciliate.\u003e","\u003cThe transfer of this taxon to \\i{}Lolium\\i0{} (Darbyshire 1993) was evaluated in Aiken et al.

Herbarium specimens suggest that at least some of the subspecies have been introduced to North America but how extensively is not known.\u003e","\u003cThe transfer of this taxon to \\i{}Lolium\\i0{} (Darbyshire 1993) was evaluated in Aiken et al. (1997). \\par{}Information in the above description is based on: the few specimens that have been collected in North America, European specimens at CAN, and the description given by Markgraf-Dannenberg (1980). \\par{}\\i{}Festuca gigantea\\i0{} is highly self-fertile and thus the taxon contrasts with most other fescues (Beddows 1931).\u003e","\u003cDarbyshire (1993) transferred this species to the genus \\i{}Lolium\\i0{} which was evaluated in Aiken et al. (1997). \\par{}Meadow fescue was once popular as a forage in North America but it is cultivated less frequently. It may be found growing in abandoned pastures in the Ottawa, Ontario area. It is not as productive or persistent as tall fescue which has been much more widely planted this century. The distribution of Meadow fescue is restricted by its moisture requirement and like tall fescue it is not grown without irrigation in the mid-west.\u003e","\u003cDuring the preparation of the treatment of \\i{}Festuca\\i0{} for \\i{}The Jepson Manual: Higher plants of California\\i0{} (Aiken 1993), no reasons for recognizing subspecific taxa in \\i{}F. elmeri\\i0{} were found. \\par{}Alexeev (1980), as translated, indicated that \\i{}F. elmeri\\i0{} has been assigned to this monotypic section and is endemic to the states of Oregon and California. It differs from other species of subg. \\i{}Subulatae\\i0{} in having blades that are ribbed on top, short bidentate lemmas on the apices of which are awns that emerge between the bidentate apices, and longer anthers. \\i{}Festuca elmeri\\i0{} is similar to \\i{}F. subuliflora\\i0{} Scribn. in these characters... It can be assumed that the species \\i{}F. elmeri\\i0{} emerged as a result of the hybridization of \\i{}F. subulata\\i0{} Trin. and \\i{}F. subuliflora\\i0{} and that it inherited the ribbed blades, the structure of the lemmae and the large anthers from the second parent and the structure of the callus from the first parent. \\par{}Aiken et al. (1997) in analyses of this database concluded that \\i{}F. elmeri\\i0{}, \\i{}F. subulata\\i0{}, and \\i{}F. subuliflora\\i0{} are distinct, but closely related and possibly sister taxa.\u003e","\u003cPiper (1913) commented that the North American grass referred to as \\i{}F. fratercula\\i0{} Rupr. ex Fourn. is not that plant at all, but an unnamed species, which he proceeded to name, \\i{}F. sororia\\i0{}. \\par{}This is a rare species that occurs in Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico in mountain ravines. Cronquist et al.

(1997) mapped the distribution of species that they placed in subg. \\i{}Subulatae\\i0{}, sect. \\i{}Subulatae\\i0{} and noted that in this section \\i{}F. sororia\\i0{} is the most distinct species, but unlike the other taxa it has never been placed in a distinct subgenus. The species has a limited distribution in the south-western United States that suggests it may have been separated from its near relatives and evolved in isolation, or that the species may have nearer relatives in Mexico. \\par{}This species has been looked for at the type locality, but not found there recently (personal communication, J. \u0026 C. Reeder 1997).\u003e","\u003c\"The three species, \\i{}F. subulata, F. subuliflora\\i0{} Scribn., and \\i{}F. elmeri\\i0{} Scribn. \u0026 Merr., have many unusual features in common, but apparently are amply distinct\", from Hitchcock et al. (1969). Analyses of this database, that involve these species, were discussed in Aiken et al. (1997).\u003e","\u003c\"This species is closely related to \\i{}F. elmeri\\i0{} Scribn. \u0026 Merr. which also has bifid, strongly veined lemmas and blades hairy on the ventral surface, but which differs in ligule character and in the non-jointed rachilla segments. The three species, \\i{}F. subulata \\i0{}Trin., \\i{}F. subuliflora\\i0{}, and \\i{}F. elmeri\\i0{}, have many unusual features in common, but apparently are amply distinct,\" from Hitchcock et al. (1969). The distribution map of the species presented in Aiken et al. (1997). suggested that two of the species have limited west coast distributions. The analyses of this database suggested that the three species are more closely related than the species in sect. \\i{}Obtusae\\i0{}.\u003e","\u003cThe taxonomic rank of this species was reconsidered by Aiken and Lefkovitch (1993) after the suggestion by Gould (1975) that this taxon may be merely a subspecies of \\i{}F. subverticillata\\i0{} (Pers.) E. B. Alexeev. The former authors concluded that phenotypic plasticity results in northern specimens of \\i{}F. paradoxa\\i0{} often having small spikelets and morphological measurements that fall within the traditional ranges of characters of \\i{}F. subverticillata\\i0{}. Branches of pre-anthesis inflorescences of \\i{}F. subverticillata\\i0{} can have a wide range of lengths and are often drooping and clustering during some stages of development. In the southern part of the distribution range, their spikelets can become similar in size to some of those of \\i{}F. paradoxa\\i0{}. Characters often found in published keys, that were found to overlap in values, are: (a) length of the longest inflorescence branch, (b) number of spikelets per branch, and (c) spikelet width. \\par{}The following distinguishing attributes are considered more reliable. \\par{}Inflorescence branches not reflexed at maturity; spikelets clustered, consistently overlapping each other by 1/3 to 1/2 their length on the lower branches; spikelets clavate in bud; upper glume almost as long as or longer than the first lemma.... \\i{}F. paradoxa\\i0{} \\par{}Inflorescence branches reflexed at maturity; spikelets often widely separated on the lower branches, sometimes overlapping slightly towards the ends of the branches; spikelets lanceolate in bud; upper glume usually shorter than the first lemma.... \\i{}F. subverticillata\\i0{}\u003e","\u003cAlexeev (1980, 1985) used the name \\i{}F. subverticillata\\i0{} for this species but did not explain his reasons, beyond listing basic synonymy. A detailed, unpublished study of the nomenclature by S. J. Darbyshire, Department of Agriculture Canada, and his discussions with the late A. Cronquist, New York Botanical Gardens, resulted in acceptance of the name \\i{}F. subverticillata\\i0{} (Aiken and Darbyshire 1990, Gleason and Cronquist 1991). Aiken and Lefkovitch (1993) suggested characteristics on which this species is most reliably separated from \\i{}F. paradoxa\\i0{} Desv. (see notes for that species).\u003e","\u003cAiken and Lefkovitch (1993) stated that in the course of their study it had become apparent that \\i{}F. versuta\\i0{} may have affinities with subg. \\i{}Obtusae\\i0{} rather than monotypic status in subg. \\i{}Drymanthele\\i0{} sect. \\i{}Texanae\\i0{} as Alexeev (1980) had suggested. Although the spikelet lengths of many specimens of \\i{}F. versuta\\i0{} are conspicuously larger than those of the other two species in subg. \\i{}Obtusae\\i0{}, small specimens overlap in size with large specimens of \\i{}F. paradoxa\\i0{} Desv. and \\i{}F. subvertillicata\\i0{} (Pers.) E. B. Alexeev. The spikelet shape in \\i{}F. versuta\\i0{} approaches that of large specimens of \\i{}F. subverticillata\\i0{}, while spikelet widths and their arrangement on the inflorescence branches are often similar to those of \\i{}F. paradoxa\\i0{}. In the analyses of this database, the two nearest neighbours of \\i{}F. versuta\\i0{} are \\i{}F. paradoxa\\i0{} and \\i{}F. subverticillata\\i0{}, and the three taxa group together in phenograms (Aiken et al. 1997).\u003e"]},{"type":"TE","id":106,"name":"\u003cnotes on data collection\u003e","data":["\u003cIntermountain Flora, Feb. 1990.\u003e","","","","","\u003cdata checked 25 March 1993.\u003e","","","","\u003cAiken and Darbyshire, 1990; Flora Europaea, Sept.1993.\u003e","","","","","","","","","","","","\u003cAiken and Darbyshire 1990, Intermountain Flora as \\i{}F. ovina\\i0{} var. \\i{}rydbergii\\i0{}, Feb. 1990.\u003e","\u003cgathered for Jepson Manual project: Sept. 1993.\u003e","","\u003cData based on European specimens at CAN, Literature accounts, and approximately 10 collections from North Russian steppes, Tzvelev 1976, Markgraf-Dannenberg 1980.\u003e","","","\u003cData based on specimen sent in by Kathryn Beck and Florence Caplow, from Washington, Benton Co.
